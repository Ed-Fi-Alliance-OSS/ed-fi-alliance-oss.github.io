With the recommendation to use the ODS for single year data collection and the
[announcement](../docs/reference/0-roadmap/notifications/migration.md) of end of
support for the Migration Utility, we committed to delivering lightweight SQL
migration scripts for non-breaking changes â€” and today, weâ€™re delivering on that
promise.

We are excited to announce the release of [ODS-API Upgrade Scripts
v1.0](https://github.com/Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/ODS-API-Upgrade-Scripts/releases/tag/v1.0).
Specifically, these scripts contain instructions and scripts for upgrading from
Ed-Fi ODS/API version 7.1 to 7.2 and Ed-Fi ODS/API version 7.2 to 7.3, designed to
streamline the upgrade process for your Ed-Fi ODS/API installations.
