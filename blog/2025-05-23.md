We are excited to announce the release of **Ed-Fi Admin Console 1-RC1** (Release Candidate 1)!

## What is the Ed-Fi Admin Console?

The Ed-Fi Admin Console is an open-source tool designed to simplify the administration of Ed-Fi ODS/API instances in  multi-instance and multi-tenant  environments with ODS/API 7. It provides a modern, React/TypeScript-based UI and .NET Core worker processes for robust, scalable management of Ed-Fi technology stacks.

The source code was granted by The Texas Education Exchange, which runs as "Tech Console" as a large implementation for many districts, and modified to work for other agencies to use.
