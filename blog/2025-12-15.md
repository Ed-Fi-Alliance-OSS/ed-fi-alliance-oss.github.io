We’re excited to announce the **0.7 release** milestone for the [Ed-Fi Data
Management Service
(DMS)](https://github.com/Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/Data-Management-Service/).This
release focuses on multi-tenancy foundations, operational cost optimizations,
and improved performance for scalable deployments.

## Key Updates

1. **Database Segmentation and Multi-Tenancy**:  DMS now supports database
   segmentation—one web API instance can serve multiple databases, improving
   scalability, isolation, and flexibility for large-scale deployments. Building
   on this foundation, both DMS and the DMS Configuration Service have been
   updated to support multi-tenant deployments.
   - [Database Segmentation
   Strategy](<https://github.com/Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/Data-Management-Service/blob/main/docs/DATABASE-SEGMENTATION-STRATEGY.md>)
   - [Multi‑Tenancy: Getting
   Started](https://github.com/Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/Data-Management-Service/blob/main/docs/MULTI-TENANCY-GETTING-STARTED.md)

2. **Built-in Identity Provider (optional)**: The DMS Configuration Service* can
   act as a built‑in Identity Provider using OpenIddict, enabling self‑contained
   authorization. Keycloak remains fully supported as an external OAuth/OIDC
   Identity Provider for organizations that prefer or require it.
3. **Removes OpenSearch/Elasticsearch**: This release removes the
   OpenSearch/Elasticsearch backends. The team validated that PostgreSQL alone
   can meet current read/write needs while reducing operational cost and
   complexity—especially in multi‑tenant scenarios. This change also addresses
   architectural issues around limit/offset and totalCount, and changes Kafka streaming
   from required to optional.
4. **Performance Tuning**: Targeted optimizations based on performance test
   results have been implemented, with more improvements planned for upcoming
   releases.

:::note

\* DMS Configuration Service is a separate component designed to manage
claimsets, authorization metadata, and configuration data for DMS deployments.
