The Ed-Fi Alliance has adopted a cadence of releasing breaking changes to the
Ed-Fi Data Standard on alternating years. 2025 is such a year and the next
release of the Ed-Fi Data Standard - and consequently the Ed-Fi Resources API -
will be labeled version 6.0. With a release date months away in Q4, we are
inviting early commentary on the changes made to date, in two domains:

1. Merge the Educator Preparation Data Model (EPDM, fka TPDM) into the core
   Ed-Fi Data Standard, and expand it to include a new use case around
   apprenticeships.
2. Enhance the data model to better support student record transfer,
   particularly for IEP data as a student moves from one school to another.

Swagger file), please see [RFC 27 - Data Standard 6.0 (Preview
