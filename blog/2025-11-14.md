## Key Breaking Changes in 6.0

This release introduces **breaking changes**, aligned with the Ed-Fi Alliance’s [release cadence](/reference/roadmap/cadence/#key-notes-on-the-cadence). Here are the highlights:

<!-- truncate -->

- **Decoupled demographics and contact information** from `StudentEducationOrganizationAssociation` into dedicated entities for cleaner modeling.
- **Added optional identity entities** to support managing multiple identification codes per student, staff, candidate, and education organization.
- **Updated the assessment model** for improved flexibility and alignment with real-world practices.
- **Expanded educator program coverage** with new domains:
  - Credential
  - Educator Preparation Program
  - Path
  - Performance Evaluation
  - Recruiting & Staffing

These changes were fully vetted through the Ed-Fi Alliance governance process, including community events, workgroup meetings, and the Technical Advisory Group.

## What’s Next: Data Standard 6.1 (Spring 2026)

Version 6.1 will deliver **non-breaking changes** with two major goals:

- **Special Education Data Model (SEDM)**
  Incorporate the [Special Education Data Model](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_G9uCSoi016Y1lNe4KJ4XpErfDTmuURltsOYUYAL_zg/edit?tab=t.0) into the Ed-Fi Data Standard. For those familiar with MetaEd and UDM extensions, you can preview [the model files](https://github.com/edanalytics/edfi-etc-sedm-extension) generated by Education Analytics.

- **Expanded Career and Technical Education (CTE) support**
  Synthesizing work already underway in several states to provide robust CTE data handling.

## Call to Action

The Ed-Fi Data Standard is fully realized when integrated into an API application. The upcoming **Ed-Fi ODS/API v7.3.1** will bundle support for **Data Standard 6.0**, alongside existing support for versions 5.2 and 4.0.

Look for the formal release announcement in this blog by November 19.
