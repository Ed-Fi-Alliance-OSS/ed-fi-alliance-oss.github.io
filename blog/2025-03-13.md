## What's Changed

The fourth milestone on our journey to a production-ready release of the Data
Management Service (DMS) introduces Configuration Management Service backed by
configuration data store, namespace-based authorization, and Keycloak
integration as the identity provider.

## Key Updates

1. Introduces [DMS Configuration
   Service](https://github.com/Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/Project-Tanager/tree/main/docs/CS),
   designed to be compatible with Admin API 2.2
2. Implements [OAuth
   support](https://github.com/Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/Project-Tanager/blob/main/docs/AUTH.md)
   via KeyCloak.
3. Enforces token-based authorization for all Descriptor API and Resource API
   endpoints in DMS.
4. Introduced namespace-based authorization for Descriptors and namespace-scoped
   resources (e.g., Assessments).

Additionally, this milestone included API client SDK generation testing for
compatibility with ODS API SDK, a basic eTag implementation, and expanded
end-to-end test cases.
