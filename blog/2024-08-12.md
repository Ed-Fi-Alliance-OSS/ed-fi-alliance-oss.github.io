## What's Changed

This second milestone on our way to a production-ready release of the Data
Management Service adds full referential integrity handling to the basic
validation support from the first milestone:

<!-- truncate -->

1. Rejecting POST or PUT requests that have references to documents that do not
   yet exist.
2. Reject PUT or DELETE requests that would "break" the references coming in
   from another document.
3. Validation of all descriptors used in POST or PUT requests.
   - In the Ed-Fi Resource API, descriptors are _not references_, but from an
     application backend perspective, they are specialized version of a
     reference, and largely treated as such.

In addition, several edge case bugs were resolved to bring better parity between
the ODS/API and the Data Management Service; database configuration was
simplified to a connection string, providing the operator with greater control
over the connection properties; and end-to-end test cases were expanded.

## Next

The next milestone, 0.3.0, will focus on enabling GET by query using a streaming
database architecture that leverages Debezium for change data capture, Kafka for
streaming, and OpenSearch for query support.
