This first milestone release of the new Ed-Fi Data Management Service provides a
PostgreSQL-backed Ed-Fi API with the following features:

<!-- truncate -->

- JSON validation on POST and PUT requests
  - Type inference / coercion is enabled, for example so that the string `"1"`
    can be treated as the number `1`, as in the Ed-Fi ODS/API
- Database persistence for POST, PUT, and DELETE requests
- Ability to retrieve a specific item using GET "by id"
- Ability to retrieve the first 25 items for a resource by using GET "all"
- An OAuth token endpoint that accepts any `client_id` and `client_secret` and
  generates a fake token, strictly for applications that need something to
  authenticate against.
- Full support of the following API definitions:
  - Ed-Fi Resources API 5.1 (with no extensions)
  - Ed-Fi Descriptors API 5.1
  - Ed-Fi Discovery API 2.0 (draft)

The list of features _not_ included is very large. Some highlights:

- Full paging support
- GET by query
- Change Queries
- Storage using SQL Server
- Reference and Descriptor validation
- Extension support
- Security of any kind

See
[Proposed Features and Milestones](https://github.com/Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/Project-Tanager/discussions/6)
for information on what comes next.

To see this system in action locally, start the service using `dotnet` or Visual
Studio, or try using the Kubernetes setup. Try running the Bulk load scripts in
the `eng/` directory to load a fake data set.
