title: '📢 Upcoming Ed-Fi OneRoster® Support in ODS/API 7.3.2'

The Ed-Fi Alliance and 1EdTech® are working together to better align standards
and simplify rostering across the K–12 EdTech ecosystem.

State, regional, and local education agencies, vendors, and managed service
providers (MSPs) are asking for simpler, more consistent ways to roster students
and provision learning tools at scale. Today, managing multiple rostering
patterns across states and products introduces friction — and slows down
onboarding at the moments when students and teachers need systems to “just
work.”

The Ed‑Fi Alliance and 1EdTech® have partnered to address that challenge through
a coordinated solution that brings OneRoster 1.2 capabilities directly into the
Ed‑Fi ODS/API. As part of this effort, we are preparing the Ed-Fi OneRoster API
release and subsequent enhancements in ODS/API 7.3.2. Together, these updates
streamline deployment and security, making it easier than ever for agencies to
provide a OneRoster-compliant endpoint using data they already have.

## What's Included

### Ed-Fi OneRoster Release

The upcoming Ed‑Fi OneRoster API enables agencies and vendors to serve a
OneRoster 1.2 endpoint using the data they already maintain within an Ed‑Fi ODS.
Key capabilities include:

- **Broad Compatibility:** Compatible with Ed‑Fi Data Standard 4.0 and 5.2
- **Supporting data structures:** Includes required mappings and database views
  to serve OneRoster API
- **Infrastructure Flexibility:** Supports both PostgreSQL and MSSQL backends
- **Standardized Deployment:** Officially published Docker image on Docker Hub
  to simplify setup and reduce onboarding effort

### ODS/API 7.3.2 Enhancements

The next iteration of the ODS/API introduces deep integration for OneRoster
resources:

- **Enhanced Discoverability:** OneRoster resources are surfaced through
  standard API discovery and Swagger UI, making the API easy to explore and test
- **Unified Login:** Features a unified login experience and integrated Ed-Fi
  Authorization across both standard Ed-Fi and OneRoster APIs
- **Built-in Security Metadata:** OneRoster-related OAuth scopes will be built
  into the core security configuration
- **Add-on Architecture:** The OneRoster API is surfaced as a seamless add-on
  feature, allowing for easier management and access

## Why This Matters

Participating MSPs and vendors have identified using one rostering integration
pattern as a key benefit in early design and field validation. This approach
significantly reduces the support burden associated with maintaining multiple
rostering pipelines. By relying on data already present in Ed‑Fi ODS
implementations, states can improve accuracy and speed during LMS onboarding and
back‑to‑school preparation.

This work builds on real collaboration and experience in the field, and we are
grateful to our Rostering Steering Committee partners for their work in helping
get this underway. It reflects the shared effort of the [Rostering Steering
Committee members](https://www.1edtech.org/about/partners/ed-fi).

## What’s Next

Additional documentation and getting started guidance will be shared as the
release approaches, including details on deployment, setup and security
configuration. Over the coming months, we will support states and educational
agencies, vendors, and MSPs as they evaluate timelines, test implementations,
and prepare for rollout alongside ODS/API 7.3.2. The Ed‑Fi Alliance looks forward
to continued collaboration with the community as we collectively work toward
simpler, more reliable rostering integrations. Interested in preparing for
