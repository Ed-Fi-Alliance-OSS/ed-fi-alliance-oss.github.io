title: '📢 Upcoming Ed‑Fi OneRoster® Support in ODS/API 7.3.2'

The Ed‑Fi Alliance and 1EdTech® are working together to better align standards
and simplify rostering across the K–12 EdTech ecosystem. This collaboration aims
to simplify data exchange and reduce friction for vendors and agencies
supporting both standards-so educators can focus on teaching rather than
troubleshooting, and students have access to the right tools on day one.

As part of this effort, we are preparing the Ed-Fi OneRoster API release and and
subsequent enhancements in ODS/API 7.3.2. Together, these updates streamline
deployment and security, making it easier than ever for agencies to provide a
OneRoster‑compliant endpoint using data they already have.

## What's Included

### Ed-Fi OneRoster Release

This coordinated technical solution is designed to support real-world adoption
and scalable implementation through several key capabilities:

- **OneRoster 1.2 API:** Serves a OneRoster 1.2 API from data stored in an Ed‑Fi
  Operational Data Store
- **Broad Compatibility:** Compatible with Ed‑Fi Data Standard 4.0 and 5.2
- **Supporting data structures:** Includes required mappings and database views
  to serve OneRoster API
- **Infrastructure Flexibility:** Supports both PostgreSQL and MSSQL backends
- **Standardized Deployment:** Officially published Docker image on Docker Hub
  to simplify setup and reduce onboarding effort

### ODS/API 7.3.2 Enhancements

The next iteration of the ODS/API introduces deep integration for OneRoster
resources:

- **Enhanced Discoverability:** OneRoster resources are surfaced through
  standard API discovery and Swagger UI, making the API easy to explore and test
- **Unified Login:** Features a unified login experience and integrated Ed-Fi
  Authorization across both standard Ed-Fi and OneRoster APIs
- **Built-in Security Metadata:** OneRoster-related OAuth scopes will be built
  into the core security configuration
- **Add-on Architecture:** The OneRoster API is surfaced as a seamless add-on
  feature, allowing for easier management and access

## What’s Next

Additional documentation and getting‑started guidance will be shared as the
release approaches, including details on deployment, setup and security
configuration. The Ed‑Fi Alliance looks forward to continued collaboration with
the community as we work toward simpler, more reliable rostering integrations.
