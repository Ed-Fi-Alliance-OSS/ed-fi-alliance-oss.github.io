The recent Ed-Fi blog post
[New Cloud-Native Functionality Coming to the Ed-Fi Alliance Technology Suite](https://www.ed-fi.org/blog/cloud-native-ed-fi-technology/)
introduced a piece of software under active development, the Ed-Fi Data
Management Service.

Eventually, this software will replace the Ed-Fi ODS/API Platform.
Unsurprisingly, a few themes emerged in the questions and conversations at Ed-Fi
Tech Congress 2024. We've begun addressing those in a new
[Frequently Asked Questions](/reference/roadmap/api-faq)
page in the Project Tanager repository. And we'll continue adding questions and
answers on that page as they come upk.

:::note

Project Tanager, as explained in the
[project's readme](https://github.com/Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/Project-Tanager/blob/main),
is a code name for the _project_ to create new _products_, of which the Data
Management Service will be the key component.
