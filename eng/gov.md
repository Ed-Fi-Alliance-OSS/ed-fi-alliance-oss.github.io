About Ed-Fi Governance
======================

* * *

This documentation describes the Ed-Fi Alliance's governance process, and how community members and the general public engage in that process.

The diagram below shows the Alliance's 3-tiered structure of governance and community engagement.

![](https://edfi.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/20316162/Ed-Fi%20Governance%20Structure.png?version=3&modificationDate=1715095452814&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=711&height=400)

In the diagram:

* Tier 1 represents the voice of the stakeholders (education agencies, vendors, and thought leaders). This tier affords stakeholders the opportunity to propose and debate changes to the Ed-Fi data model and technology through participation in various work groups.
* Tier 2 is composed of representatives from the Alliance, work group chairs, and at-large representatives coming together as a [Governance Advisory Team (GAT)](https://edfi.atlassian.net/wiki/display/GOV/Governance+Advisory+Team) to prioritize proposed changes and poll the broader Ed-Fi Community. The GAT receives input from and is supported by the Ed-Fi community and Ed-Fi Alliance staff.
* Tier 3 is the approval and advocacy group for the governance structure.

Active Work Groups
==================

* * *

Work groups at the Tier 1 level are open to all Ed-Fi community members. If you are interested in learning more about these work groups or becoming a member, please express your interest by e-mail to [governance@ed-fi.org](mailto:info@ed-fi.org).
