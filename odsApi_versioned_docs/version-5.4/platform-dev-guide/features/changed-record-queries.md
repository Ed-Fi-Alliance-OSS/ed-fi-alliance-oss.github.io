# Changed Record Queries

The Ed-Fi ODS / API platform contains data that gets updated frequently. The
platform can track inserts, updates, and deletes, and surface those changes to
client systems through a feature called changed record queries, or "change queries."
Change queries allow client systems to narrow requests for data to only data
that has changed since a specified point in time. This allows client systems to
stay in sync with the ODS / API without having to pull a complete data set.

Client system interaction is documented in the [Using the Changed Record Queries](https://edfi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ODSAPIS3V54/pages/22774464/Using+the+Changed+Record+Queries) section of the API Client Developers' Guide.

Change queries is an optional feature and is turned on by default â€” but can be turned off through configuration. This feature also provides an option that enables platform hosts to provide API clients with isolated context for processing changes. This documentation covers the essentials for
platform hosts to enable and manage the feature.

## Enabling Change Queries

The change query feature is enabled by default since v5.1.0, and the schema
changes are included with all Ed-Fi provided backups. These steps are provided to
manage including the feature on previous versions as part of an upgrade, or to
reenable the feature after disabling it.

The feature is managed on the deployed code by changing the appsettings.json file of the EdFi.Ods.WebApi project. This is the appsettings.json of the "Api" component of the deployed solution. The app setting `ApiSettings:Features:ChangeQueries` should be set to the value "true". If the app setting doesn't exist, it should
be created.

The following snippet shows the app setting:

```json
"ApiSettings": {
    ...
    "Features": [
      {
        "Name": "ChangeQueries",
        "IsEnabled": true
      },
    ...
}
```

To enable change queries, the database must be also be updated using the
provided scripts. These scripts will set up a new database schema and all the changes
necessary to support change queries. All scripts supporting change queries will
exist under a subfolder named "changes" inside the "Ods" target database folder
(i.e.,
\Ed-Fi-ODS\Application\EdFi.Ods.Standard\Artifacts\MsSql\Structure\Ods\Changes). Scripts will be generated for this feature by MetaEd for Ed-Fi Extension
projects as well.

Note that in development environments, initdev process automatically deploys the
change query schema based on the "ApiSettings:Features:ChangeQueries" flag in the appsettings.json file of the EdFi.Ods.WebApi project. This means that a development instance
will typically not require any additional database scripts to be run.

In non-development environments, the schemas are already included with most
provided backups, but can be applied if working with an older release or reapplying
the feature by deploying the necessary change scripts to the target ODS
database(s). The exact steps depend on your deployment method:

* If you are using the built-in deployment PowerShell scripts, update the
configuration.json to set the "ApiSettings:Features:ChangeQueries" flag to "true". Same changes to configuration.json are needed while installing databases using
the EdFi.Suite3.RestApi.Databases NuGet package. Performing a deployment on top
of an existing ODS database after setting this flag will correctly execute the
change queries scripts, which perform the necessary updates to enable change
queries functionality.
* If the built-in deployment scripts are not being used, all scripts under the
"changes" inside the "Ods" target database folder
(Ed-Fi-ODS\Application\EdFi.Ods.Standard\Artifacts\MsSql\Structure\Ods\Changes) must be run against the ODS, including the extension version of the scripts (Ed-Fi-ODS-Implementation\Application\{your extension
project}\Artifacts\MsSql\Structure\Ods\Changes).

## Disabling Change Queries

It is normally recommended to leave change queries on, in order to support
client integrations that rely on it. However, if a field implementation wants to
remove the feature, it can be done by turning the feature flag off in the
appsettings.json, and then deleting the database objects from all ODS instances.

The scripts below for SQL Server and PostgreSQL will generate an
appropriate idempotent cleanup script to remove all change query related artifacts, for both
core and extensions. Execute the attached script, review the output to verify what
is being deleted, and then execute the generated script to remove the database
objects for change queries. As always, it is recommended to take a backup prior
to making major modifications to the ODS. This process would need to be done to
each ODS.

## Technical Details

The change queries function uses basic versioning concepts. A global version
counter is introduced using a Sequence object, and each table representing the
top-level entities of a data domain are given a ChangeVersion column to represent
the current version of the entity instance. These columns are set up with triggers
to ensure they are automatically updated based on the latest value of the
sequence on all inserts and updates, whether they come from the API or through
scripts. Queries done against the API to find changed records function by adding an
additional where clause to based on this ChangeVersion column.

Supporting delete tracking requires another common change tracking concept,
using a "tombstone" table. This concept involves tracking all deletes and storing a
record of what was deleted, to allow future querying against deleted records. In
this case, the pattern is implemented using a delete trigger on the main table,
and the resource id and primary key of the deleted record are then stored in
the tracking table for deletes. API requests to retrieve information on deletes
queries against these tables to retrieve the resource ids of deleted entity
instance.

Note that there is a concern in use cases with very high volume of deletes or
for very long running ODS instances where the size of these delete tracking tables
can get very large, taking up a disproportionate percentage of the database
storage. In that case, these tables can be truncated periodically, the only risk
being losing visibility into any deletes that are removed by this truncation. Given the typical uses cases of using an ODS per school year, no automatic
truncation was introduced by default since it's unlikely to be an issue for most
implementations.

The patterns described above are used for both the standard, as-shipped Ed-Fi
ODS database tables, as well as tables generated to serve Ed-Fi Extensions. By
using [MetaEd v2.x](https://edfi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/METAED20) (the recommended method for extending the Ed-Fi ODS / API), scripts are
generated to support the ChangeVersion column, insert/update/delete triggers, and
delete tracking tables. This allows hosts to have consistent support for the feature
across their entire API, even for new top-level entities introduced by Extension
projects.

# Changed Record Queries with Snapshot Isolation

In order to provide an environment for API clients that can guarantee data
consistency for downstream processing of Ed-Fi ODS data, it is highly recommended that API hosts setup snapshots and provide isolated snapshots to use with Change
Queries workflow.

This feature provides a mechanism for API clients to make API requests that are
served from a static copy of the ODS database isolated from ongoing changes in
the underlying ODS database. This isolation avoids data consistency problems,
processing failures, and, significantly, undetected missing data (or data changes)
in the target system.

The following ODS / API artifacts are relevant for snapshot isolation:

* A database table (`changes.Snapshot`) to capture basic information about the available snapshots.
* A "snapshots" API resource (at `/changeQueries/v1/snapshots`) which enables API clients to read the snapshot identifier of an available
snapshot (or snapshots). Clients then supply the identifier with each API request
using the `Snapshot-Identifier` HTTP header.
* API support for processing the `Snapshot-Identifier` HTTP header to service API requests using the corresponding static ODS data
source rather than the live operational ODS.

## Creating and Managing Snapshots

In order to provide an isolated context for API clients' processing, Platform
hosts must implement DevOps processes to maintain a periodically refreshed static
copy of the API's main ODS database, and the corresponding records in the `changes.Snapshot` table.

This would typically be implemented as a basic scheduled database
backup-and-restore operation. For SQL Server users with a server-based installation (rather
than a managed, cloud-based offering), it could also be implemented using SQL
Server's lighter-weight "Database Snapshots" feature.

**Sample creation of a SQL Server Database Snapshot**

```sql
CREATE DATABASE EdFi_Ods_Sandbox_CW39oP8dfsLr0yXVGTixq_SSabcd ON
(
    NAME = EdFi_Ods_Populated_Template_Test,
    FILENAME = 'C:\MSSQL\MSSQL14.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA\EdFi_Ods_Sandbox_CW39oP8dfsLr0yXVGTixq_SSabcd.ss'
) AS SNAPSHOT OF EdFi_Ods_Sandbox_CW39oP8dfsLr0yXVGTixq;
```

The host's process MUST perform the following steps:

* Back up the current EdFi_Ods database (or equivalent).
* Generate a short string-based "snapshot identifier" (GUID-based values are discouraged to prevent
name length problems when possibly combined with other API features that
increase ODS database name length).
* Restore the ODS database using following naming convention: {Ed-Fi ODS database name}_SS{snapshot-identifier}.
* Insert a new record into the `changes.Snapshot` table with the new snapshot identifier and the current date/time.

The host's process SHOULD also perform the following steps:

* Drop old snapshot databases.
  * Hosts may choose to maintain the last 2 snapshot databases to avoid dropping a
database that could be currently in use by an API client. If that were to happen,
the client would begin receiving `410 Gone` responses from the API indicating they need to start over with their
processing and synchronize using the new snapshot.
* Remove corresponding records from `changes.Snapshot` table for the dropped snapshots.
