# Ownership Based Authorization

The Ed-Fi ODS / API primarily uses a relationship-based authorization strategy
based on education organizations. Ownership based authorization adds an optional
additional level of authorization that can be used in scenarios where more
granular access controls are needed. Refer to [API Claim Sets & Resources](https://edfi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ODSAPIS3V54/pages/22774347/API+Claim+Sets+Resources) for details on various available authorization strategies. This documentation
covers the essentials for platform hosts to enable and manage the feature.

Ownership based authorization is an optional feature that is turned off by
default - but can be turned on through configuration. When this feature is turned on,
each aggregate root entity in the ODS is assigned with an ownership token
indicating the access rights to that resource. EdFi_Admin database holds ownership
tokens for the API clients. API populates the new ownership token property on the
aggregate root entity from the API client's key context. Authorization metadata in EdFi_Security database allows platform hosts to
configure multiple authorization strategies for a given resource/action combination to
use ownership based authorization strategy in conjunction with existing
relationship based authorization strategies. API Authorization layer identifies
multiple matching authorization strategies for a request, and applies multiple sets of
filter criteria to apply authorization.

The following steps demonstrate setting up ownership based authorization:

## Enabling Ownership Based Authorization

The Ownership based authorization feature is managed on the deployed code by
changing the appsettings.json file of the EdFi.Ods.WebApi project. This is the appsettings.json of the "Api" component of the deployed solution. The app setting `ApiSettings:Features:OwnershipBasedAuthorization` should be set to the value "true". If the app setting doesn't exist, it should
be created.

The following snippet shows the app setting:

```json
"ApiSettings": {
    ...
    "Features": [
      {
        "Name": "OwnershipBasedAuthorization",
        "IsEnabled": true
      },
    ...
}
```

To enable ownership based authorization, the database must be also be updated
using the provided scripts. These scripts will set up a new column in all
aggregate root entities and necessary to support this feature. All scripts supporting
ownership based authorization will exist under a subfolder named "RecordOwnership"
inside the "Ods" target database folder (i.e.,
\Ed-Fi-ODS\Application\EdFi.Ods.Standard\Artifacts\MsSql\Structure\Ods\RecordOwnership). Scripts will be
generated for this feature by MetaEd for Ed-Fi Extension projects as well.

Note that in development environments, initdev process automatically deploys
these scripts based on the "ApiSettings:Features:OwnershipBasedAuthorization" flag in the appsettings.json file of the EdFi.Ods.WebApi project. This means that a development instance will
typically not require any additional database scripts to be run.

In non-development environments, the schemas are already included with most
provided backups, but can be applied if working with an older release or reapplying
the feature by deploying the necessary change scripts to the target ODS
database(s). The exact steps depend on your deployment method:

* If you are using the built-in deployment PowerShell scripts, update the
configuration.json to set the "ApiSettings:Features:OwnershipBasedAuthorization" flag to "true". Same changes to configuration.json are needed while installing
databases using the EdFi.Suite3.RestApi.Databases NuGet package. Performing a
deployment on top of an existing ODS database after setting this flag will
correctly execute the ownership based authorization scripts, which performs the
necessary updates to enable ownership based authorization functionality.
* If the built-in deployment scripts are not being used, all scripts under the
"RecordOwnership" inside the "Ods" target database folder
(Ed-Fi-ODS\Application\EdFi.Ods.Standard\Artifacts\MsSql\Structure\Ods\RecordOwnership) must be run against the ODS, including the extension version of the scripts (Ed-Fi-ODS-Implementation\Application\{your extension
project}\Artifacts\MsSql\Structure\Ods\RecordOwnership).

:::warning
**Existing ODS updates may be required.**

Ownership based authorization relies on appropriate ownership tokens marked on
aggregate root entities. Once the feature is enabled, these tokens are set
during record creation. However, when setting up ownership based authorization on an
existing ODS, existing data must also be updated with ownership tokens in order
for authorization to work properly.

## Setting up Security Metadata

Ownership based authorization feature takes advantage of claims-based
authorization to apply the ownership based authorization strategy against specific
resources.

Steps to set up security metadata involve:

1. Create a new Record Level Ownership claim set
2. Insert resource claim actions
3. Insert claim set resource claim actions
4. Insert claim set resource claim action authorization strategy overrides

## Configuring the API Client

Steps to configuring the API Client involve:

1. Update Application Table to Use Record Level Ownership Claim Set
   a. (Claim set was created as part of Setting up Security Metadata)
2. Create an Ownership Token for each API Client
3. Assign the Creator Ownership Token to each API Client
4. Assign the Ownership Token to each API Client

DECLARE @ClaimSetName NVARCHAR(255)
DECLARE @ApplicationName NVARCHAR(MAX)
   
SET @ClaimSetName = 'Ownership Based'
SET @ApplicationName = 'Default Sandbox Application Sample'
     
UPDATE Applications
SET ClaimSetName = @ClaimSetName
WHERE ApplicationName = @ApplicationName
 
INSERT INTO OwnershipTokens(Description)
SELECT client.[Name] + ' Ownership Token'
FROM Applications a
JOIN ApiClients client ON client.Application_ApplicationId = a.ApplicationId
WHERE a.ApplicationName = @ApplicationName
 
UPDATE ac
SET ac.CreatorOwnershipTokenId_OwnershipTokenId = ot.OwnershipTokenId
FROM ApiClients ac
JOIN Applications a ON a.ApplicationId = ac.Application_ApplicationId
JOIN OwnershipTokens ot ON ot.Description = ac.[Name] + ' Ownership Token'
WHERE a.ApplicationName = @ApplicationName
 
INSERT INTO ApiClientOwnershipTokens(ApiClient_ApiClientId, OwnershipToken_OwnershipTokenId)
SELECT ac.ApiClientId, ot.OwnershipTokenId
FROM ApiClients ac
JOIN Applications a ON a.ApplicationId = ac.Application_ApplicationId
JOIN OwnershipTokens ot ON ot.Description = ac.[Name] + ' Ownership Token'
WHERE a.ApplicationName = @ApplicationName
```

## Preparing an existing ODS

The need to update an existing ODS is not necessary for new instances of the ODS. However, in
the cases where an existing ODS needs to be able to support ownership based
authorization, existing entities need to be updated to have ownership tokens
assigned to them.

Steps to prepare an existing ODS involve updating one or more existing aggregate
root entities with Ownership Tokens. Aggregate root entities can be identified by the resources exposed by the REST API.

**Updating one or more aggregate root entities**

```sql
DECLARE @ApiClientName VARCHAR(500) = 'Populated Demonstration Sandbox'
DECLARE @CreatedByOwnershipTokenId int = (
    SELECT CreatorOwnershipTokenId_OwnershipTokenId
    FROM EdFi_Admin.dbo.ApiClients
    WHERE [Name] = @ApiClientName
)
  
DECLARE @RecordLevelOwnershipTables TABLE (TableName varchar(50))
INSERT INTO @RecordLevelOwnershipTables
-- Add table names here
VALUES
('Student')
  
DECLARE @TableName VARCHAR(100);
DECLARE @SchemaName VARCHAR(100);
DECLARE @SQL NVARCHAR(1000);
  
SELECT  c.name  AS 'ColumnName',t.name AS 'TableName', s.name as 'SchemaName'
INTO #RecordLevelOwnershipTables
FROM sys.columns c
JOIN sys.tables  t   ON c.object_id = t.object_id
JOIN sys.schemas s ON s.schema_id = t.schema_id
JOIN @RecordLevelOwnershipTables rlot ON rlot.TableName = t.name
WHERE c.name = 'CreatedByOwnershipTokenId'
ORDER BY TableName,ColumnName;
  
DECLARE TableCursor CURSOR
  LOCAL STATIC READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY
FOR
SELECT DISTINCT TableName
FROM #RecordLevelOwnershipTables
  
OPEN TableCursor
FETCH NEXT FROM TableCursor INTO @TableName
WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
BEGIN
    SET @SchemaName = (SELECT SchemaName From #RecordLevelOwnershipTables Where TableName = @TableName)
    SET @SQL = 'UPDATE ' + @SchemaName + + '.' + @TableName + ' SET CreatedByOwnershipTokenId = ' + CONVERT(VARCHAR(50) , @CreatedByOwnershipTokenId)
    PRINT @SQL
    EXEC (@SQL)
    FETCH NEXT FROM TableCursor INTO @TableName
END
CLOSE TableCursor
DEALLOCATE TableCursor
  
DROP TABLE #RecordLevelOwnershipTables
```

**Updating all aggregate root entities**

```sql
DECLARE @ApiClientName VARCHAR(1000) = 'Populated Demonstration Sandbox'
DECLARE @CreatedByOwnershipTokenId int = (
    SELECT CreatorOwnershipTokenId_OwnershipTokenId
    FROM EdFi_Admin.dbo.ApiClients
    WHERE [Name] = @ApiClientName
)
  
DECLARE @TableName VARCHAR(100);
DECLARE @SchemaName VARCHAR(100);
DECLARE @SQL NVARCHAR(1000);

    FETCH NEXT FROM TableCursor INTO @TableName
END
CLOSE TableCursor
DEALLOCATE TableCursor
  
DROP TABLE #RecordLevelOwnershipTables
```
</details>

## Verifying a successful setup

In order to verify a successful setup, Swagger UI or Postman can be used to
query the API to ensure that aggregate root entities configured to use ownership
based authorization are returned correctly.

## Technical Details

The tables involved in ownership based authorization are as follows:

### EdFi_Security Database

The application of an "ownership-based" authorization strategy is done in an
additive fashion. To facilitate this, EdFi_Security database schema has been updated to allow configuration of multiple authorization strategies for the default resource claim/action "tuples" as well as for claim set-specific overrides.

### EdFi_Admin Database

In order to authorize individual resource items in the API based on the concept
of "ownership", each API client is associated with "CreatorOwnershipTokenId"
that is captured with each resource the client creates. The API client's claims
information also includes a list of "ApiClientOwnershipTokens" that can be used to
identify which resource items they currently "own", and the authorization
process will filter results and access against this list against based on the target
resource's "CretedByOwnershipTokenId" value.

### Ed-Fi ODS Database

Each aggregate root entity table in the ODS has a CretedByOwnershipTokenId field
used to assign an ownership token to each record.

Eg. Student Table
