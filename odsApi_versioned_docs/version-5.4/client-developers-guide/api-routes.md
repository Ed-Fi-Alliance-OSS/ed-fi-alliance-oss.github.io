# API Routes

Routes are names used to access API endpoints and are used in API URLs. This
section describes the patterns and conventions for route naming in the Ed-Fi ODS
/ API.

## Route Patterns in Ed-Fi APIs

The Ed-Fi ODS / API uses the following route structure to support multiple
Extensions and to provide support for API versioning:

| Description | ODS / API Route |
| --- | --- |
| Base URI | `/{api_area}/{version}/{instance}`<sup>1</sup>`/{year}`<sup>2</sup><br/><br/>**Examples:**<br/><br/>/data/v3 <br/>/composites/v1 <br/>/identity/v2 |
| Basic Relative URL Format | Data Management Resources:  <br/>â€¦/`{org}`/`{resource}`<br/><br/>API Composites:  <br/>.../`{org}`/`{category}`/`{resource}` |
| **Examples** |     |
| Resources (Ed-Fi) | /data/v3/ed-fi/schools |
| Descriptors (Ed-Fi) | /data/v3/ed-fi/termDescriptors |
| Resources (Host Extensions)<sup>3</sup> | /data/v3/TX/leavers |
| Resources (Domain Extensions)<sup>3</sup> | /data/v3/talentMgmt/applicants |
| Composites (Ed-Fi)<sup>4</sup> | /composites/v1/ed-fi/assessment/studentAssessments |
| Composites (Host Organization) | /composites/v1/MI/enrollment/Schools |
| Composites Based on Domain or Host Extensions | Unsupported |
| Identity | /identity/v2/identities<sup>5</sup> |

Notes:

1. Instance is optional in the route.
2. School Year is optional in the route.
3. It is important to note the distinction between the **Extended Ed-Fi
   Resources** (which collect additional data for an existing Ed-Fi core
   resource using the \_ext field in the JSON payload) and **Host & Domain
   Resources** (which create entirely new resource endpoints).
4. Composites are treated as a reserved word.
5. Endpoint for identity feature is clearly separated to allow separate versioning for this feature and to
   support implementations that are not using this optional feature.


### Example: Extended Ed-Fi Student Resource

Route: `/data/v3/ed-fi/students`

Sample JSON Payload for extended Student:

```json
{
    "studentUniqueId": "397589871",
    "firstName" : "John",
    "lastSurname": "Ortiz",

    [etc...]

    "_ext" : {
        "SomeState" : {
            "tribalAffiliation" : "Pascua Yaqui",
            [etc...]
        }
    }
}
```

### Example: TalentMgmt Applicant Resource

Route: `/data/v3/talentMgmt/applicants`

Sample JSON Payload for Applicant in a "talentMgmt" extension:

```json
{
    "id": "string",
    "applicantIdentifier": "397589871",
    "educationOrganizationReference": {
      "educationOrganizationId": 255901,
    },
    "addresses": [
      {
        [etc...]
      }
    ],
    [etc...]
}
```
