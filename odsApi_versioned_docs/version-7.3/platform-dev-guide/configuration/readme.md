# Configuration

Like most web applications, the Ed-Fi ODS / API has several configuration
settings. Some configuration values, such as database connection strings, must
be supplied for every instance. Others are optional and change the behavior of
the system. This section provides an overview of the primary files that contain
configuration settings. Main configuration location is in the EdFi.Ods.WebApi
project (found in the `Ed-Fi-ODS-Implementation\Application\EdFi.Ods.WebApi`
directory of the ODS / API solution) contains the primary configurations for an
instance of the Ed-Fi ODS / API. By customizing the `appsettings.json` you
should be able to modify the API to suit your needs. `appsettings.json` includes
settings for database connection strings and the settings that enable various
configurable features. For more detail on the configuration files and the
specific values, see the [Configuration Details](./configuration-details.mdx)
section of this documentation. `log4net.config` includes logging configurations
for the Ed-Fi ODS / API, see [Logging
Configuration](./logging-configuration.md) section for details.

## Security Configuration

In addition to the configuration settings above, the Ed-Fi ODS / API allows
implementers to configure several aspects of the application security:

* **Claim Sets.** Changes to claim sets provide fine-grained access control
    over data accessible by clients.
* **API Profiles.** Profiles allow implementers to create data policy that
    specify exactly what access is allowed for particular kinds of client
    systems. For example, student information systems in an enterprise might
    require broad access to data, including students, grades, attendance,
    discipline incidents, assessment results, and so forth, while a gradebook
    application might only need access to student and gradebook data.

For more detail on the security aspects of the Ed-Fi ODS / API, see the
[Security](../security/readme.md) section
of this documentation.
