# Ed-Fi API Publisher Configuration

The Ed-Fi API Publisher provides a hierarchical organization of configuration information, as documented below.

The first layer of configuration values are provided by the _publisherSettings.json_ file, which should reside in the same folder as the Ed-Fi API Publisher's binaries. This file contains the general Options available for altering the runtime behavior.
The Options values can also be supplied (overridden) using environment variables or command-line arguments, as needed.

Command-line arguments take precedence over environment variables, which in turn take precedence over the values defined in the _publisherSettings.json_ configuration file. To use environment variables to provide configuration values, use the "Configuration Path" from the tables below, and add an `EdFi:Publisher:` prefix to the name of each variable. For example, to specify a named connection for the source API using an environment variable, use an environment variable name of `EdFi:Publisher:Connections:Source:Name`.

## Options

## API Connections

Metadata for source and targets API connections can be supplied to the publisher using values stored in a persistent configuration or through environment variables and/or command-line arguments, as documented below. It is **strongly recommended** that you use named connections with persistent configuration for repeated publishing operations (e.g. `--sourceName=abcd --targetName=wxyz`). You should not mix named connections with overrides supplied through environment variables or command-line arguments.

> NOTE: If the Ed-Fi API Publisher is executed using explicit connection information (rather than a pre-configured _named_ connection), the LastChangeVersionProcessed value cannot be updated automatically upon successful publishing (as there is no API connection name associated with the information). It will be the responsibility of the caller to update the value appropriately after extracting the new change version from the log output (or through some other enterprising manner). As such, for implementing a process that is intended to only publish _changes_ from a source to a target, it is impractical to use an approach where the API connection details are provided explicitly at execution time.

To select or supply source and target connection information, the following configuration values apply:

The value is defined using a CSV format (comma-separated values), and should contain the partial paths to the resources (e.g. _/ed-fi/students_,_/custom/busRoutes_). For convenience when working with Ed-Fi standard resources, only the name is required (e.g. _students,studentSchoolAssociations_). The Ed-Fi API Publisher will also evaluate and automatically include all dependencies of the requested resources (using the dependency metadata exposed by the target API). This will ensure (barring misconfigured authorization metadata or data policies) that data can be successfully published to the target API. |

The value is defined using the same format as with `--include` (see above). The Ed-Fi API Publisher will also evaluate and automatically exclude all dependent resources of the excluded resources (using the dependency metadata exposed by the target API).

This argument must also be provided and set to `true` if the source API does not support an isolated context through the use of the snapshots resource (i.e. before Ed-Fi ODS v5.2). (NOTE: This is not a flag -- the value `true` or `false` must be provided (i.e. `--ignoreIsolation=true`).)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Connections:Target:TreatForbiddenPostAsWarning<br/>`--treatForbiddenPostAsWarning` | (_Optional_) A boolean value (true/false) indicating whether `403 Forbidden` responses from `POST` requests against the connection (as a target) should be treated as a warning, rather than a failure.<br/><br/>NOTE: This option can be used in scenarios where the target API may not grant the Ed-Fi API Publisher full CRUD permissions to all the dependencies of the specified resources to be written. In such a scenario, the dependent data must already exist in the target ODS or the resulting `409 Conflict` responses will cause publishing failure.                                                                                                                                                                         |

## Considerations in relation to key changes and deletes

Ed-Fi API Publisher will only process key changes and deletions if  specific Change Window is defined. To do so use the
`--lastChangeVersionProcessed` value and set the `--useChangeVersionPaging` flag to true.
Another option, if you want to keep the `--useChangeVersionPaging` false is defining a name for the source and target, using the
`--sourceName` and `--targetName` values. More information about all these values [below](API-Publisher-Configuration.md#api-connections).

## Authorization Failure Handling

Defines metadata (as an array of JSON objects) about which resources could experience `403 Forbidden` responses caused by data dependencies needed for successful authorization, and which other resources should be processed before retrying the original request. For example, while an API client may be able to create a Student, they won't be able to _update_ the Student until that Student is enrolled in a School through the StudentSchoolAssociation. By defining the authorization-related dependency of the _update_ operation on the StudentSchoolAssociation, the Ed-Fi API Publisher can know to retry the failed POST request after the association has been established.

NOTE: This part of the configuration can only be defined in the _publisherSettings.json_ file.

| /authorizationFailureHandling\[\*]                         | Defines metadata for a single resource which could experience 403 Forbidden responses.                                                                                                                       |
| /authorizationFailureHandling\[\*]/path                    | The partial path for the resource (e.g. _/ed-fi/students_) for which additional 403 Forbidden processing should be performed.                                                                                |
| /authorizationFailureHandling\[\*]/updatePrerequisitePaths | An array of partial paths for the resource(s) (e.g. _/ed-fi/studentSchoolAssociations_) that should be processed before attempting to retry the original request which resulted in an authorization failure. |

The default configuration, which will probably suffice for all current Ed-Fi ODS API deployments, is as follows:
```json
{  
  "options":   
  {  
    ...
  },  
  "authorizationFailureHandling": [  
    {  
      "path": "/ed-fi/students",  
      "updatePrerequisitePaths": ["/ed-fi/studentSchoolAssociations"]  
    },  
    {  
      "path": "/ed-fi/staffs",  
      "updatePrerequisitePaths": [  
        "/ed-fi/staffEducationOrganizationEmploymentAssociations",  
        "/ed-fi/staffEducationOrganizationAssignmentAssociations"  
      ]  
    },  
    {  
      "path": "/ed-fi/parents",  
      "updatePrerequisitePaths": ["/ed-fi/studentParentAssociations"]  
    }
  ]
}
```
