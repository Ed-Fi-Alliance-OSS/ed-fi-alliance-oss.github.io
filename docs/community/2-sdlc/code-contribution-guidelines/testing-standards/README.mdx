# Testing Standards

## General Principles

1. Test-driven development using the
    [red-green-refactor method](https://www.jamesshore.com/Blog/Red-Green-Refactor.html)
    is encouraged.
2. Definitions:

      style={{ float: 'right' }}
    />

        1. **Unit tests.** Unit tests are run in isolation, with limited (ideally
            no) hard-coded dependencies on other classes, and absolutely no
            dependencies on external resources such as a database, filesystem, web
            service, or similar.
        2. **Integration tests.** These are tests that _do_ connect to external
            resources, and therefore may need additional setup to prepare those
            resources and teardown to clean them up afterward.
        3. **End-to-end (E2E) tests.** These are a special case of _integration
            test_ where the interaction with the system is driven end-to-end through
            a graphical user interface, console application, or other long-running
            process.

3. Ed-Fi test suites usually follow the test pyramid philosophy:
    1. Write a lot of _unit tests_, with high coverage for all but the most
       trivial code.
    2. Write _integration tests_ where appropriate; though fewer in number, they
       are essential for ensuring that parts work together. Why fewer? Because
       they are usually hard to write and harder to maintain.
    3. Build _end-to-end tests_ sparingly, as they are the most expensive to
       execute and to maintain.
4. When joining an existing project, always look at the prevailing testing
    conventions and follow them when creating new tests or modifying existing
    ones. In consultation with the primary development team and Ed-Fi Alliance
    tech staff, those prevailing conventions are open to modification â€” but only
    under those two conditions.
5. When it seems impossible to write a unit test, take another look: this
    usually signals the presence of a dependency that can be extracted to an
    [Adapter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern) / Wrapper class and
    injected into the class under test. The Adapter / Wrapper is usually \*_not_
    covered by unit tests and should contain the minimum logic needed to
    redirect arguments to the real dependency class.
6. Prefer test methods that assert a single truth. However, multiple assertions
    may be necessary in cases where it is important to assert an object is not
    null before asserting a truth on one of its properties. Note that the
    following examples use Shouldly methods instead of NUnit's "Assert.XYZ"
    methods.

    ```csharp
    // Bad
    [Test]
    public void Given_some_condition_then_expect_some_results()
    {
     // ... arrange and act (execute)

     // ... and now Assert / validate the results
     result.PropertyOne.ShouldBe(1);
     result.PropertyTwo.ShouldBe("two");
    }


    // Good
    [Test]
    public void Given_some_condition_then_expect_property_one_to_be_1()
    {
     // ... arrange and act (execute)

     // ... and now Assert / validate the results
     result.PropertyOne.ShouldBe(1);
    }

    [Test]
    public void Given_some_condition_then_expect_property_two_to_be_2()
    {
     // ... arrange and act (execute)

     // ... and now Assert / validate the results
     result.PropertyTwo.ShouldBe("two");
    }

    // In many cases, the test suite will be rearranged so that the
    // test setup method will execute the test and each test method
    // would contain only one line - the single assertion.
    ```

    **Guard Clause Assertions**

    ```csharp
    // We don't want a null reference exception, and therefore introduce
    // a not-null guard clause assertion. The assertions with
    // 'results.Value.Any' arguably should have been in a separate method.
    [Test]
    public void A_test_with_guard_clauses()
    {
     // ... arrange and act (execute)

     // ... and now Assert / validate the results
     result.ShouldNotBeNull();

     // Safely use multiple assertions once the guard clause
     // has been satisfied. Two styles shown:

     // native NUnit style:
     Assert.Multiple( () =>
     {
      result.Value.Length.ShouldBe(6);
      result.Value.Any(x => x.GetType() != typeof(NpgsqlParameter))
          .ShouldBeFalse();
     });

     // preferred Shouldly style:
     result.ShouldSatisfyAllConditions(
      () => result.Value.Length.ShouldBe(6),
      () => result.Value.Any(x => x.GetType() != typeof(NpgsqlParameter))
           .ShouldBeFalse();
     );
    }
    ```

7. Use fake objects appropriately.
    [Mocks are not stubs](https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html);
    take care not to abuse mocks by making unit tests tightly coupled to
    implementation.

    :::tip

    The FakeItEasy framework does not make a strong distinction between mocks
    and stubs. Nevertheless, the point stands that mocks can be taken overboard,
    which results in brittle tests.
