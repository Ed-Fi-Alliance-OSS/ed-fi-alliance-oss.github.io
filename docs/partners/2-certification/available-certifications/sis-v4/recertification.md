# Student Information Systems API v4 Re-certification

## Re-certification

A product that has previously certified is eligible for an alternative
re-certification process in order to maintain a certified status. The
re-certification process focuses on ensuring that the original certified
functionality has been maintained. The steps are the same as those
under [Student Information Systems API for Data Standard v4 Certification -
Steps](./certification-steps.md) with these changes.

* If any documentation submitted previously is out of data, it MUST be
  re-submitted and brought up to date.
* Implementation verifications MUST be re-submitted or renewed.
* Transactional and batch testing can be submitted asynchronously.
* A synchronous test session will be scheduled.
  * Certification requirements introduces since the product last certified will
    be tested, in order to ensure the product meets all requirements.
  * A random sample of the live transactional tests will be performed.
