# SIS API Certification Use Cases

## Document Purpose

Provide a resource to community members for understanding the educational use
cases that underpin the Ed-Fi SIS API Certification.

## Audience

Agencies, vendors, local education agency collaboratives, and implementation
partners

## Background and Description

Ed-Fi certification represents an agreement between agency customers and vendor
providers. This agreement comprises:

* a scope of data
* API specifications
* compatibility with current data standard and technology suite versions
* additional normative requirements on system interaction
* adherence to general best practices
* their connection to solving for high value use cases the community has defined
  and prioritized together.

The resulting certification requirements are intended to form a clear,
well-defined, and executable ask of vendors by agencies. For vendors,
certification defines capabilities to build into their products for replicable
and high-quality integrations across the K12 community and ecosystem.
