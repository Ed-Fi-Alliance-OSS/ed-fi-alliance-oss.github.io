These use cases apply to the CCMR community priority.

## Use Case 8: (Note this use case also applies to [Multiple Measures of Assessment](./multiple-measures-of-assessment.md))

### As a school district, I want to be able to track each student’s progress towards district and state graduation requirements, so that we can intervene early to assist students. We also want data on overall course catalog demands for the coming years for curricular and staffing planning purposes and to recognize important patterns in student success
