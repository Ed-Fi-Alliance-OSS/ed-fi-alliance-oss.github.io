# Ed-Fi Certification

Ed-Fi certifications allow product developers to demonstrate a product's
fidelity to Ed-Fi standards and guidelines, and for purchasers or users to be
confident that a product conforms to those same Ed-Fi standards and guidelines.

The Ed-Fi certification program was developedÂ from the experience of many
education agencies in certifying Ed-Fi-compliant data exchanges for their
enterprise systems. The Ed-Fi Alliance has built on that foundation to provide a
certification that can be used across different agencies and organizations,
alleviating the need for vendors to undergo multiple, overlapping local
certifications.
