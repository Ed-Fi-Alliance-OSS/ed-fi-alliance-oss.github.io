## Alignment with new Break-Rest Development Cadence

Certification requirements are aligned to the Ed-Fi Data and API Standard Release Cadence
* Support goes from 3 to 4 years
* Certification will continue to be annual 
* Vendors should certify on everything that is active, we always encourage on the latest 
* There will be some experimental areas of domains to change more rapidly than the cadence (those areas will not be included in testing)
