# Product Availability Information

The data provider MUST provide information on the availability of all
functionality that was used to complete certification. That information MUST
include documentation that outlines the states and the data standard versions supported
where the partner:

* Has an existing customer
* Supports all data elements required under certification
* Supports state reporting implementations

This information is submitted by using the form provided below.

The Alliance will publish information from this statement as part of the
certification record, so that the Ed-Fi community can understand availability of
the certified functionality.

## Format

---

The information MUST be submitted by the data provider seeking certification
using the
[Required Form](<https://edfi.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/293896203/Ed-Fi%20Certification%20-%20Availability%20Statement%20V2.docx?api=v2>).
Information from this form will be published as part of the product's
certification record.

### Requirements

* Geographic information MUST be (at a minimum) precise enough to allow any
  local education agency operating within the United States to determine if it
  is or is not within the specified geography.
* Version information MUST be for versions generally available on the market
  (i.e., version information MUST not include development or future versions).
  Note that for Ed-Fi certification generally, only functionality actually
  available in the market can be certified, not functionality under development.
* Non-specific information MUST NOT be included (e.g., â€œPlease contact us for
  availability information").

## Rationale

The main goal of collecting availability information is to enable users of Ed-Fi
certification records to determine if they have access to certified product
functionality, and for providers to clarify their customers or users
expectations on availability.

In the initial years of Ed-Fi certification, a number of issues emerged from the
lack of clarity on where and if an education agency could get access to data
exchange functionality defined by Ed-Fi standards. In some cases, an education
agency took a dependency on certified functionality based on a certification
record only to later discover that they did not have access to that
functionality.

Data providers likewise experienced customer misunderstandings based on
certification records, and expressed a need to clarify where and when the
certified functionality was available.

Detailed availability statements make it easier for new agencies to identify
suitable vendor and make informed decisions. Agencies can quickly assess which
partners have experience in their state and with their specific requirements.

By allowing partners to list more detailed availability it allows them to
demonstrate expanded support for various states and data standard versions,
and incentivizes partners to offer certified functionality across the ecosystem.

Clear availability information can highlight gaps in support for certain states
or versions, guiding partners in support of certain regions to fill identified gaps.

:::warning The Ed-Fi Alliance recommends that agencies involve their data
providers early in the process of project planning, and communicate with those
providers about the goals of agency projects. Certification records should not
be used as a proxy for communication with providers whose systems will be
critical to project success. :::
