# Pricing Statement 
To ensure transparency and help agencies make informed purchasing decisions, all 
partners must submit information about the cost of Ed-Fi certified functionality to 
be published on the registry. This includes documentation outlining whether or not 
the partner charges additional fees for certified Ed-Fi functionality. This will help 
agencies understand what is included in the standard engagement and what may incur 
additional costs.

## Format and Requirements
The information MUST be submitted by the data provider seeking certification using the 
[Required Form](https://edfi.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/335740941/Ed-Fi%20Certification%20-%20Pricing%20Statement%20V1.docx?api=v2). Information from this form will be published as part of the product's 
certification record. 

Partners must provide a document detailing the product's pricing structure. This should outline:
1. General information about whether Ed-Fi functionality covered in certification is
included or incurs additional costs.
3. List of states where additional fees for Ed-Fi certified functionality apply. 

## Rationale

* Informed Decisions: The community has requested more upfront information about which
partners charge for Ed-Fi integrations. This transparency will help agencies make better
purchasing decisions.
* Customization Clarity: By understanding which of their requirements are customizations,
agencies can make more informed requests and reduce the need for customizations and extensions.
* Clear Availability: Providing clear information about pricing and availability will help
agencies discuss their needs with vendors more effectively.
