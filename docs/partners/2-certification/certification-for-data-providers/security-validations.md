# Optional registry entry to link security and data privacy validations

To enhance transparency and trust, Ed-Fi now offers certification holders the option to display a link to their security and data privacy validations on the Ed-Fi Registry. This feature helps schools and agencies quickly assess the security posture of Ed-Fi-certified products, supporting informed procurement decisions.

## Why This Matters

* Increases Transparency: Districts and agencies can easily review vendor security practices.
* Streamlines Procurement: Quick access to security documentation reduces evaluation time.
* Supports Trust: Demonstrates vendor commitment to data protection and compliance.

## What Can Be Linked

Linkable, vendor-maintained security verification pages such as:

* SOC 2 reports
* ISO 27001 certifications
* Other recognized security frameworks

**Important:** Only links to pages maintained by the certification holder will be accepted.
