# Ed-Fi Badges

Ed-Fi Badges allow product developers to demonstrate support for Ed-Fi standards
and technology, particularly in areas that are not yet covered by an [Ed-Fi
Certification](https://edfi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EDFICERT/overview).

Many products that use Ed-Fi standardized APIs or integrate natively with Ed-Fi
technology tools (such as
the [Ed-Fi Operational Data Store and API](https://edfi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TT/pages/18645319))
are forging new ground in terms of defining data integration use cases valuable
to schools. Badges allow these efforts to be validated and recognized by the
community.

Badges are not intended nor should they be used as a "lightweight"
certification, either by technology providers or the education agencies they
support. Over time, some badges may act as precursors to new certifications.

Unlike certification, badges also focus on both Ed-Fi standards as well as Ed-Fi
technology tools; by contrast, Ed-Fi certifications only focus on Ed-Fi
standards.
