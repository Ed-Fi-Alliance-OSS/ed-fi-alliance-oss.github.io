# Applying for a Badge

## Application Elements

### 1. Application Form

The application includes basic information about the product and functionality
seeking a badge.

[Application
form](https://edfi.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/20611181/Ed-Fi%20Badge%20Application%20(3).docx?version=1&modificationDate=1683898134510&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
(docx)

### 2. Data Model Integration Information

This requirement only applies to the [Ed-Fi API Consumer
Badge](./available-badges/ed-fi-api-consumer-badge.md) and [Ed-Fi ODS Platform
Consumer Badge](./available-badges/ed-fi-ods-platform-consumer-badge.md).

The product must supply a list of all Ed-Fi data elements that are part of the
badge-related functionality. These elements must be employed within the badge
product to produce some kind of output that is of value to product users and
consistent with the core value provided by the product.

For the format, the mapping must

* be in a spreadsheet format.
* in header information, state the version numbers of the Ed-Fi standards or
  products which apply to the data elements (e.g. "The data elements listed are
  for Ed-Fi Data Standard 3.1"). If the product has multiple version support, it
  is permitted to default these to the most recent Ed-Fi version supported.
* for the Ed-Fi data elements, use the exact terms from either the Ed-Fi Data
  Handbook, the Ed-Fi API element name, or the Ed-Fi ODS database element name

### 3. Implementation Verification

The Alliance must receive at least one customer verification that the narrative
(from the application form) is accurate and the integration is in use.  This
form must be submitted by an education agency that is a member of the Ed-Fi
community.  You can find the [verification form
here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScAA-zTBOabLepUwPIj2mR6jIC66P07_Q9Ba5s3OQl5gX-XcA/viewform?usp=sf_link).

## Review and Validation

When all application elements are complete, the Ed-Fi Alliance will reach out to
schedule an online, synchronous inspection of the product functionality. The
technology provider will be asked to share their screen and demonstrate the
product functionality that is the basis for the badge.

When review and validation is complete, the badge will be awarded. Badges are
good for 2 years.

In the event that it is unclear if a product qualifies or not for the badge, the
Alliance will refer the decision to the [Ed-Fi Governance Advisory Team
(GAT)](https://edfi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GOV/pages/20317448/Governance+Advisory+Team).
The Alliance reserves the right to provide any information from the badge
application to the GAT in order to make this decision.
