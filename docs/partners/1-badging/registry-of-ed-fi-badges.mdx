# Registry of Ed-Fi Badges

This page lists products that have been awarded an Ed-Fi badge.

## Ed-Fi Managed Service Provider Badge

The Ed-Fi Managed Service Provider Badge is for products that provide the
Ed-Fi Operational Data Store and API (ODS/API) as software-as-a-service (SaaS).

Data integration and use at scale is a challenging problem regardless of
platform, and these challenges have particularly been difficult for agencies
with lower access to expertise in software development, enterprise data
management, or data systems integration. Similarly, many larger agencies are
also attempting to outsource aspects of these operations in order to focus more
on analytics and business intelligence. This badge highlights product efforts
to address these problems.

## Ed-Fi API Consumer Badge

This badge is for products that read data out of an Ed-Fi defined API and
integrate that data into their product offering.

## Ed-Fi Implementation Partner Badge

The Ed-Fi Systems Implementer Badge is to recognize services organizations
doing field implementation work around the Ed-Fi technology stack, which may not
be directly relatable to a software product.

Many agencies are forming short term, project based relationships to perform
specific tasks with Ed-Fi technology - upgrades, system integrations, and
strategy consulting. This badge aims to define organizations that follow best
practices in a wide range of services projects.
