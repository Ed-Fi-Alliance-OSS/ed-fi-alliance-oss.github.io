# Ed-Fi Implementation Partner Badge

![Ed-Fi Implementation Partner Badge](https://edfidocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/img/partners/badging/ed-fi-implementation-badge.webp)

The Ed-Fi Implementation Partner Badge recognizes vendors that consistently deliver services aligned to Ed-Fi best practices and enable successful adoption of the Ed-Fi data standard across multiple implementations.

This badge is awarded based on a demonstrated ability to deliver repeatable, scalable services that lead to aligned, standards-based implementations in a variety of customer contexts. It reflects a partner’s capability, leadership, and alignment with the Ed-Fi community’s goals for data quality, interoperability, and long-term ecosystem impact.

## Requirements

:::info

In addition to the specifics listed below, a vendor must satisfy all applicable
core requirements listed in [Badging Requirements for Technology
Providers](../badging-requirements.md).

:::

Applicants for the Implementation Partner Badge must:

* Demonstrate alignment to Ed-Fi best practices and data standards through completed implementations
* Show repeatable implementation practices across at least two verified projects
* Participate in project retrospectives to reflect on lessons learned and ensure alignment with Ed-Fi guidance
* Provide evidence of change management processes relevant to Ed-Fi implementations
* Provide verifiable documentation of implementation methods, internal tools, and process frameworks
* Actively participate in the Ed-Fi community and governance structures

### What We Mean by "Repeatable Services"

Repeatability refers to a partner’s ability to consistently deliver effective, scalable services aligned to Ed-Fi implementation guidance. This includes:

* Applying reusable internal playbooks, templates, or code packages
* Delivering services that can be sustained across agencies, geographies, or vendor ecosystems
* Following guidance from Ed-Fi’s Implementation Playbooks, Technical Deployment materials, and Solution Guides
* Contributing to implementations that result in standards-aligned, community-compatible outcomes

### Core Service Areas We Look For

The badge process evaluates whether a partner consistently delivers services that align to the following areas:

* Ed-Fi strategy and implementation planning
* Technical architecture and environment configuration
* ODS/API deployment and management
* Data mapping, validation, and extension minimization
* Vendor coordination and onboarding
* Project management and change facilitation
* Stakeholder engagement and governance support
* Documentation, training, and LEA enablement
* Operational and post-deployment support

Partners may also propose additional service areas for review, if those services directly support Ed-Fi-aligned implementations.

### Verifications - Quality

Like other badges, a verifying agency/company is required. The nature of the
verification is important due to the custom nature of offering
implementation services.

* The verified vendor implementation must also be badged/certified to
  qualify as a verification. This is required to ensure that implementation
  services are following best practices and current certification/badging
  requirements.
* Collaboratives or regional service centers can provide verification if their
  solution is badged as a “Ed-Fi Managed ODS API Platform Badge”
* Ed-Fi may use a developer to look at code of the implementation to look
  for best practices (e.g. look for multi-threading in code to support best
  practice)
* Verifications from individual LEAs/SEAs require a deeper validation than other
  means to ensure adherence to Ed-Fi standards and repetability.  Vendors should
  consider productizing their service for more streamlined scale-ability.  Part
  of this verification includes validation Ed-Fi core components are used, code
  inspection to validate that best practices are being used, and reviewing
  processes exist for repeatability.

### Verifications - Quantity

Unlike other badges, the Implementation Partner badge requires two
verifications. Due to the custom nature of implementations Ed-Fi requires a
second verification to demonstrate repeatability in the marketplace.

### Proof of repeatability

Implementation partners must demonstrate their services are “productized” for
future customers. Examples of evidence includes re-usable development packages,
re-usable project plans, and/or detailed implementation documentation. These
documents can be internal intellectual property but must be shared with Ed-Fi
with enough detail to verify their existence and usage.

### Community Participation

Implementation Partners are expected to be active members of the Ed-Fi Partner Program, including:

* Participation in governance groups and community feedback processes
* Engagement with other partners and state/local agencies
* Ongoing contributions to community learning, documentation, or working groups

### Ed-Fi Project Retrospective Participation

Any project can be reported to Ed-Fi for a group retrospective. This can be done
during mid-project reviews or as the project is closed out.  Lessons learned
from the retrospective can identify gaps in best practices and will be used to
anonymously update Ed-Fi’s best practices and guidance. Badge removal may occur
if the retrospective identifies gaps in quality and repeatability by a badged
vendor that are not resolved after an appropriate time.

## Provisional Badges

New organizations without two completed implementations may apply for a Provisional Badge, which includes:

* A deeper review of tools, methods, and alignment to Ed-Fi implementation guidance
* Retrospective participation for initial projects
* Full badge eligibility upon completion and validation of two successful, aligned implementations
