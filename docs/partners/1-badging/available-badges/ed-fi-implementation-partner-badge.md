# Ed-Fi Implementation Partner Badge

![Ed-Fi Implementation Partner Badge](/img/partners/badging/ed-fi-implementation-badge.webp)

To be awarded this badge, a vendor must be able to demonstrate adherence to
Ed-Fi best practices and their services must facilitate Ed-Fi data standards
delivery in their customer's solutions.

## Requirements

<<<<<<< HEAD
### Verifications - Quality

Like other badges, a verifying agency/company is required. The nature of the
verification is important due to the custom nature of offering
implementation services.

* The verified vendor implementation must also be badged/certified to
        qualify as a verification. This is required to ensure that
        implementation services are following best practices and current
        certification/badging requirements.
* Collaboratives or regional service centers can provide verification if
        their solution is badged as a “Ed-Fi Managed ODS API Platform Badge”
* Ed-Fi may use a developer to look at code of the implementation to look
        for best practices (e.g. look for multi-threading in code to support
        best practice)
* Verifications from individual LEAs\\SEAs require a deeper validation

        than other means to ensure adherence to Ed-Fi standards and
        repetability.  Vendors should consider productizing their service for
        more streamlined scale-ability.  Part of this verification includes
        validation Ed-Fi core components are used, code inspection to validate
        that best practices are being used, and reviewing processes exist for
        repeatability.

### Verifications - Quantity

Unlike other badges, the Implementation Partner badge requires two
    verifications. Due to the custom nature of implementations Ed-Fi requires a
    second verification to demonstrate repeatability in the marketplace.

### Proof of repeatability

Implementation partners must demonstrate their services are “productized”

    for future customers. Examples of evidence includes re-usable development
    packages, re-usable project plans, and/or detailed implementation
    documentation. These documents can be internal intellectual property but
    must be shared with Ed-Fi with enough detail to verify their existence and
    usage.

### Participation in the Ed-Fi community

Implementation partners must be in the Ed-Fi partner program. Partnership
    requires active participation in governance and the community.
    Implementation partners enable Ed-Fi throughout the community and provide a
    conduit between their customer base and current Ed-Fi practices.

### Academy Track

Implementation Partner should have at least 1 person on staff for each
    Ed-Fi project that has gone through all the Academy tracks involving Ed-Fi
    overview and best practices.

### Ed-Fi Project Retrospective Participation

Any project can be reported to

    Ed-Fi for a group retrospective. This can be done during mid-project reviews
    or as the project is closed out.  Lessons learned from the retrospective can
    identify gaps in best practices and will be used to anonymously update
    Ed-Fi’s best practices and guidance. Badge removal may occur if the
    retrospective identifies gaps in quality and repeatability by a badged
    vendor that are not resolved after an appropriate time.

## Provisional Badges

The requirement for existing successful customers can be a challenging

obstacle for new companies entering this space. New companies can apply for a
provisional badge which will require a more thorough review for best practices
and evidence of repeatability. The badge will be provisional until the
appropriate verifications are provided.  The first projects will go through the
project retrospective process so Ed-Fi can evaluate the project’s
implementations against Ed-Fi standards and best practices.
