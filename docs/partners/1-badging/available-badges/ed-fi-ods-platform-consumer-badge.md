# Ed-Fi ODS Platform Consumer Badge

:::warning
The Ed-Fi ODS Platform Consumer badge has been retired.  Any existing badges will stay in place until they expire.  These badges won't be renewed and we won't test for new badges.  

:::

## Why the change?
Retiring the Platform Consumer Badge is a continuation of the Ed-Fi Allianceâ€™s move toward API-first approaches. The Alliance no longer sees a need to verify the way databases are managed and consumed if the API is implemented correctly. As a result, Platform Consumer Badge-holders will be transitioned to the API Consumer Badge.
