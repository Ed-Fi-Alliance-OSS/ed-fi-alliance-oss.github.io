# Ed-Fi Managed Service Provider Badge

![Ed-Fi Managed Service Provider Badge](https://edfidocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/img/partners/badging/ed-fi-managed-partner-badge.webp)

The Ed-Fi Managed Service Provider Badge is for products that provide the
Ed-Fi Operational Data Store and API (ODS/API) as software-as-a-service (SaaS).

Data integration and use at scale is a challenging problem regardless of
platform, and these challenges have particularly been difficult for agencies
with lower access to expertise in software development, enterprise data
management, or data systems integration. Similarly, many larger agencies are
also attempting to outsource aspects of these operations in order to focus more
on analytics and business intelligence.  This badge  highlights product efforts
to address these problems.

## Important Info

Unlike with other Ed-Fi badges this badge is good for one year and must be
renewed annually.

## Requirements

:::info

In addition to the specifics listed below, a vendor must satisfy all applicable
core requirements listed in [Badging Requirements for Technology
Providers](../badging-requirements.md).

:::

To qualify for this badge, a product must meet the following requirements.

1. **The product must include a recent, full version of the Ed-Fi Operational
    Data Store and API.** The product must offer – at the minimum – a version of
    the ODS / API that
    1. is currently under support,
    2. was released in the past 18 months, and
    3. is part of the most recent Ed-Fi suite (please consult the Ed-Fi Suite
        Version Matrix for suite information)
2. **The product must offer a version of the Ed-Fi ODS / API that includes no
    ecosystem-facing API extensions.** Extension APIs can be offered as an
    additional add-on or configuration option to the product, but a customer
    must be able to request and purchase a non-extended version.
3. **The product must be offered on a cloud platform**, such as Microsoft
    Azure, Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud.
    1. This platform must include management of all operating system, network,
        and hardware level services, such that management and operations of
        those services are not the responsibility of the product customer and
        must be included in the product offering. Example: a virtual machine
        running in AWS, Google or Azure for which the customer is responsible
        for applying security and other patches would not quality, while a
        product offered on one of those platforms which was automatically
        maintained, patched and monitored would qualify.
    2. Installation and operation of the product within the tenancy of an
        education agency on a cloud provider platform is allowed, providing that
        the agency is not responsible for any operations (per 3.a)
    3. The platform must provide for easy, non-disruptive scaling to account
        for variations in capacity needs.
4. **The product must be available by subscription.** There can be different
    subscriptions that correspond to different service levels, add-ons, etc. but
    those must be covered under the subscription chosen by the customer.
    1. There can be "startup" or "setup" fees that are assessed for new
        customers and cover one-time setup operations.. The operations of the
        managed platform must not require other fees beyond the subscription
        after setup.
    2. If an organization has multiple products including non-managed options,
        those must be distinguished from the managed platform offering in
        marketing and other material to avoid confusion about what product
        received the badge.
5. **The product must include upgrades as part of the subscription fees**, and
    customers must have the option to be no less than 18 months behind the
    latest Ed-Fi ODS/API release.
6. **The product must include the option for Tier-2 and Tier-3 support.**
    Tier-1 support for any end-users can be provided for via agency systems
    (e.g. via a LEA help desk or ticketing system), but the product must have an
    option included in a subscription level for escalations of Tier-1 issues to
    Tier-2 and Tier-3 support.
    1. These higher support levels must cover all operations of Ed-Fi Technology Suite
        and also system integrations with the platform via API, including
        performing actions to help diagnose issues and communicate with 3rd
        party products to resolve integration issues.  These integration
        services can assume that the 3rd party is providing similar integration
        support on their end.
7. **The product must have at least 1 education agency customer and be in usage
    in that agency.** An education agency is any agency authorized to by a US
    state to provide education services directly to students. Usage can be in
    "pilot" mode or similar modes, but must not be in a trial or other transient
    or unsupported state.
8. **The product must be available in all United States geographies (i.e.
    states and territories).**

The application for the badge must include portfolio of evidence in the form of
public URLs, marketing material, or other documentation that provides evidence
of that the product meets all the requirements above. The applicant should make
clear via a manifest or cover letter where the requirements listed above are
demonstrated.

In the event that it is unclear if a product qualifies or not for the badge, the
Alliance will refer the decision to the [Ed-Fi Governance Advisory Team
(GAT)](https://edfi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GOV/pages/20317448/Governance+Advisory+Team).
The Alliance reserves the right to provide any information from the badge
application to the GAT in order to make this decision.
