# Ed-Fi Admin App v4

The Ed-Fi Admin App v4 is a web-based administrative platform designed to manage
Ed-Fi API deployments across multiple environments and tenants. It replaces
legacy tools (Ed-Fi ODS Admin App and Ed-Fi Sandbox Admin UI) and provides a
unified, scalable interface for managing client credentials, database instances,
and API health across diverse user roles and deployment models.
