# Ed-Fi Admin App v4

The Ed-Fi Admin App v4 is a web-based administrative platform designed to manage
Ed-Fi API deployments across multiple environments and tenants. It replaces
legacy tools (Ed-Fi ODS Admin App and Ed-Fi Sandbox Admin UI) and provides a
unified, scalable interface for managing client credentials, database instances,
and API health across diverse user roles and deployment models.

## Target Audiences

This applications is designed to support IT staff who are managing large-scale
deployments of the Ed-Fi API applications: managed service providers, state
agencies, data hubs. In turn, the hosting agency can provide configurable access
to delegate some maintenance tasks to local education agency staff.

Accordingly, there are two perspectives to the application documentation:

* [System Administrator's Guide](./system-adminstrators/readme.md)
* [User's Guide](./user-guide/readme.md)
