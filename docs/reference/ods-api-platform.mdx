# Ed-Fi ODS / API Platform

The Ed-Fi Alliance publishes the [Ed-Fi Data
Standard](./data-exchange/data-standard/), which models a broad spectrum of
commonly exchanged and shared K-12 education data. The Ed-Fi ODS / API is a
concrete implementation of a relational database and a companion API harmonized
with the Ed-Fi Data Standard. The Ed-Fi ODS / API is tuned to the security and
performance needs of K-12 organizations and the education technology vendors who
serve them.

The ODS implementation uses Microsoft SQL Server or PostgreSQL as a database
platform. The API implementation is written in C#. Together, these form a data
platform to host student-centric data. The ODS / API platform is vendor neutral,
meaning that client applications may be written in any language.

Please see the [Ed-Fi Technology Suite Supported
Versions](./0-roadmap/supported-versions.md) for an overview of which Data Standard
version(s) are supported by a given ODS / API version.
