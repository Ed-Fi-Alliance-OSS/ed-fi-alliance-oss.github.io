# Educator Pipeline Use Cases & Tools

A comprehensive view of the educator pipeline—from early interest through certification, hiring, and career growth—is vital to building a strong, sustainable teaching workforce. Tracking key milestones before, during, and after entry into the profession helps stakeholders support aspiring educators, reduce attrition, and ensure schools are staffed with qualified teachers. Ed-Fi-backed insights further enable targeted interventions, data-driven policies, and continuous improvement across the educator journey.
