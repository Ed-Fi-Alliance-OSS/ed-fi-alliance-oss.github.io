## Overview

This cookbook contains several MetaEd programming recipes targeted at specific
problems. Recipes are presented in a problem, solution, discussion format.

## Audience

This documentation is for technical professionals developing with MetaEd and the
MetaEd IDE.

Please note that this documentation includes concepts relevant to both the core
MetaEd system used internally by the Ed-Fi Alliance and the MetaEd IDE used by
licensees and their technical providers. For the most part, the concepts and
language constructs are identical. Information pertinent to internal — or
external — only users is marked as such.
