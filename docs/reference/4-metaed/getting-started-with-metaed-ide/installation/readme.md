# Getting Started - Installation

The MetaEd IDE installation steps are fairly straightforward. It's worth noting
that the MetaEd IDE is a plug-in to the free, open source Visual Studio Code
text editor. The installation steps below walk you through a complete install.

Detail on each step follows.

If you run into issues during install, please consult the troubleshooting
information located at: [Installation and Update
Issues](../../ide-user-guide/common-problems-and-troubleshooting.md). If you
still have issues, please raise a source case through the [Ed-Fi Community
Hub](https://community.ed-fi.org) and provide details of the issue.

## Step 1. Download and Install Visual Studio Code

Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which
is available for Windows, Linux, and MacOS

:::warning

The Ed-Fi development team does not have the resources to test
MetaEd on an Apple device. In theory, it _should_ work.

## Step 2. Install the MetaEd Extension

Open the Extensions panel from the toolbar on the left, or from the `View >
Extensions`  menu. Search for MetaEd and install the latest release version.

## Step 3. Wait for the Extension to Activate

Wait a moment for the extension to activate. When ready, you'll see a
notification that  "MetaEd has started".

## Step 4. Configure Settings

Open the settings from the `File > Preferences > Settings`  menu.  [MetaEd IDE -
Creating and Maintaining Your Extension (X)](#) provides more detail on the
settings, most of which depend on your project needs. Most importantly, please
be sure to accept the [Ed-Fi License Agreement for Use of
MetaEd](./ed-fi-license-agreement-for-use-of-metaed.md),
as shown in the screenshot below.
