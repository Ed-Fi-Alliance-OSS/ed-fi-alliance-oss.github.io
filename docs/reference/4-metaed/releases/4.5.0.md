If you already have the Visual Studio Code based editor, then it will
automatically update the MetaEd extension for you. If you are still using the
deprecated Atom based editor, then please see [MetaEd IDE - Upgrading to MetaEd
4.x](../ide-user-guide/upgrading-to-metaed-4x.md).

## Overview

Version 4.5 adds support for the ODS/API 7.3 and Data Standard 5.2 releases.

## Changes

### ODS/API 7.3

* SQL script build artifacts include new AggregateId column on aggregate root tables, index tuning, and improved Change Queries triggers.
* Support for Data Standard 5.2.

### Usability

* New IDE settings `additionalMssqlScriptsDirectory` and `additionalPostgresScriptsDirectory`: the user can provide a full filesystem path to a folder with additional deployment scripts. These will be deployed to the Ed-Fi-ODS-Implementation directory along with the generated artifacts in the MetaEd Deploy action, under `MSSQL/Data/Ods` and `PGSQL/Data/ODS`.
