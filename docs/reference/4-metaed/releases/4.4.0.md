# 4.4.0

Release date: 20 May 2024

:::tip

If you already have the Visual Studio Code based editor, then it will
automatically update the MetaEd extension for you. If you are still using the
deprecated Atom based editor, then please see [MetaEd IDE - Upgrading to MetaEd
4.x](./ide-user-guide/upgrading-to-metaed-4x.md).

:::

## Overview

Version 4.4 supports the upcoming ODS/API 7.2 and Data Standard 5.1 releases and
supports ODS/API 6.2 and 5.4 releases explicitly (formerly only supported
implicitly, by selecting the prior minor release 6.1 or 5.3). Includes improved
user error reporting for swifter diagnosis.

## Changes

* Typos in metaed settings "API source directory" should be causing deploy to
  fail but are not
* Display deployment failure message on error
* Improve error messages
* Make it easier to find data standard folders for MetaEd
* Support for 5.4 and 6.2
* Add DS 5.1

Note that there are many more changes that are not user facing, primarily in
support of [Project
Tanager](https://github.com/Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/Project-Tanager/).
