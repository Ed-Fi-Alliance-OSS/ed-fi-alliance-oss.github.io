Starting with [MetaEd v4.0](./releases/4.0.0.md), MetaEd runs on Visual
Studio Code instead of Atom. We strongly recommend that everyone in the
community move from the Atom-based version to this new one using Visual Studio
Code. Existing users: please see [MetaEd IDE - Upgrading to MetaEd
4.x](./ide-user-guide/upgrading-to-metaed-4x.md).

:::

MetaEd is a technology framework that uses an Ed-Fi-aligned domain specific
language (DSL) to auto-generate software, database, and data standard artifacts.

The internal Ed-Fi Alliance team uses MetaEd to define and produce core
components such as the Ed-Fi Standard Interchange Schema (XSD files), the Ed-Fi
ODS (SQL Scripts), and technical documentation from a single source definition
written in the MetaEd DSL.

A version of MetaEd called the MetaEd IDE supports the generation of Ed-Fi
Extensions and all related artifacts. The MetaEd IDE is freely available to
Ed-Fi community members.
