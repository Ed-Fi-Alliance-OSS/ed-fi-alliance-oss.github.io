# Data Exchange Standards

The Ed-Fi Alliance coordinates and publishes community-led standards for
education and the exchange of education data. This article collects links to The
Ed-Fi Alliance coordinates and publishes community-led standards for resources
and key publications.

## Ed-Fi Data Standards

The [Ed-Fi Data Standard](./data-standards.md) is the widely
adopted, CEDS-aligned, open-source data standard developed by the educational
community for the betterment of the community. The Ed-Fi Data Standard serves as
the foundation for enabling interoperability among secure data systems and
contains a [Unifying Data Model](./udm/readme.md) designed to capture the
meaning and inherent structure in the most important information in the Kâ€“12
education enterprise.

## Ed-Fi API Standards

An Ed-Fi compatible API application creates a REST-based interface for data
exchange, where the messages conform to the Ed-Fi Data Standard. The [Ed-Fi
ODS/API](/reference/ods-api) is the Ed-Fi Alliance's core API product, used by
nearly all "Ed-Fi deployments." Any interested party can build an alternate,
compatible, application, by adhering to the Open API specifications and guidance
provided in [Ed-Fi API Guidelines](./api-guidelines/readme.md).

API Guidelines](./api-guidelines/).

## Resources

### Standard Information & Publications

* What do we mean by "standards?" The [Ed-Fi is a Data
  Standard](https://www.ed-fi.org/ed-fi-data-standard/) article on our main
  website has an overview.
* This space contains additional documentation and technical specifications for
  our published standards; see the additional articles in the left sidebar.
* Ed-Fi data exchange standards are aligned with the reference standards
  published in the [Ed-Fi Data Standard](./data-standards.md). In particular,
  the [Ed-Fi Unifying Data Model](./udm/readme.md) is a helpful reference
  to understand the contents and structure of the data exchanges we support.
* The [Ed-Fi RFC Specifications](./rfc/readme.md) contains work-in-progress
  specifications. Although the material is still in draft form, the technical
  specifications are typically implementable. For example, the Ed-Fi community
  uses this site to publish data exchange specifications for Ed-Fi-related
  technologies.
