# Discipline Domain

The Discipline domain is based upon the concepts of a discipline incident (i.e.,
a violation or offense) and a discipline action (i.e., the consequences or
actions associated with an incident). The model accounts for both user entities
presumed to be known in the model (e.g., students and staff) and external people
entities (e.g., non-students and non-staff).
