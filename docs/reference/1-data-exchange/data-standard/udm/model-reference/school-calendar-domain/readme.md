# School Calendar Domain

The School Calendar domain represents the instructional days, sessions, and
grading periods defined for a school year. The defined sessions for a school
year are associated with the education organization – e.g., state education
agency, local education agency or school – that defines the calendar.

Note that the calendar domain is not intended to cover section (class period)
and other event scheduling during school days; those needs are covered via
the [Bell Schedule
Domain](../bell-schedule-domain/readme.md).
