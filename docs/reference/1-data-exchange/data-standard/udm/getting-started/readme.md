# Unifying Data Model - Getting Started

## Ed-Fi Data Standards in Action

A primary component of the Ed-Fi technical solution is an educational data model
that empowers educators with real-time, actionable information on every student
in their classroom, school, or district. The Ed-Fi Unifying Data Model (UDM)
integrates and organizes raw education data and information from a broad range
of data sources so it can be sifted, analyzed, and put to everyday use.

By using products based upon the Unifying Data Model, educators are equipped
with the information they need to understand the individual needs of students
and prepare to address those needs on the first day of school. In addition,
on-demand access means that action plans for students can be monitored and
refined throughout the school year.

Most importantly, technology based on the Unifying Data Model can be implemented
in any school, district, regional education service agency, or state education
agency today.

## Introduction to the Ed-Fi Unifying Data Model

The model is expressed in Unified Modeling Language (UML), and includes entities
such as students, teachers, assessment results, attendance, and many others. The
role of the Ed-Fi UDM is to harmonize the information model and data types
across all Ed-Fi standards and implementation technologies. This means that
Ed-Fi standards and technologies share common models and data definitions.

The Unifying Data Model is built on open industry protocols and conventions and
is therefore vendor-neutral. The Unifying Data Model and its derivative products
can be implemented on any hardware and software platform.
