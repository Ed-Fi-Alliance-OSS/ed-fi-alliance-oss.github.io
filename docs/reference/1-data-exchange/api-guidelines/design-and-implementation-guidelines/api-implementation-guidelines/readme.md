# API Implementation Guidelines

Ed-Fi REST API implementations frequently include features that go beyond the
basics of [API Design Guidelines](../api-design-guidelines/readme.md) ,
addressing questions around client security and client performance optimization.

This section covers the following topics in detail:

* [Handling Authentication and
    Authorization](./handling-authentication-and-authorization.md)
* [Handling Optimistic Concurrency with
    ETags](./handling-optimistic-concurrency-with-etags.md)
* [Handling Non-Repudiation](./handling-non-repudiation.md)
* [Handling Web Cache Validation with
    ETags](./handling-web-cache-validation-with-etags.md)
