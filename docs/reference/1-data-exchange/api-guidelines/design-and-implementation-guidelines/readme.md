This document describes the properties to which an API specification and related
implementation must adhere in order to be considered aligned to Ed-Fi Technology Suite
standards. They are guidelines only. They do not describe a specific
implementation or particular API specification. Where helpful, a rationale for
specific guidelines is also provided.
