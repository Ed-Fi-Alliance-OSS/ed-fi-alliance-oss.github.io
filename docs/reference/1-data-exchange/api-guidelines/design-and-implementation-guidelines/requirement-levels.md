# Requirement Levels

The sections that follow contain guidelines for Ed-Fi API designs and
implementations. Certain key terms have specific meanings in these
guidelines.Â From this point forward, key terms are italicized when used with the
specific meanings shown below:

* _Must, required, shall._ These terms indicate an absolute requirement for an
    aligned Ed-Fi API implementation.

* _Must not, shall not._ These terms indicate an absolute prohibition for an
    aligned Ed-Fi API implementation.

* _Should, recommended._ These terms indicate that there may be valid reasons
    to ignore a particular item, but the full implications must be understood
    and carefully weighed before choosing a different course.

* _Should not, not recommended._ These terms indicate that there may be
    circumstances when a particular behavior is acceptable or useful, but the
    full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before
    implementing such behavior.

* _May, could, optional._ These terms indicate items that are truly optional.
    One organization may choose to include the item because their specific
    implementation requires it or because they feel it enhances the
    implementation, while another organization may omit the item. Client
    applications must be prepared to interoperate with an implementation that
    does not include the option, although perhaps with reduced functionality. In
    the same vein, a client who does include a particular option must be
    prepared to interoperate with another implementation that does not include
    the option.

* _Aligned._ An aligned implementation meets all the "must, required, shall"
    requirements of these guidelines, and avoids the "must not, shall not"
    prohibitions.

Language for this section has been adapted for use from [_Key words for use in
RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels_](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119). This
document conforms to the guidelines provided there.
