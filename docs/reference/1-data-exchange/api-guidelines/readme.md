# Ed-Fi API Guidelines

## Introduction

The Ed-Fi API Design & Implementation Guidelines (herein after referred to as the "Guidelines") describe requirements for an Ed-Fi representational state transfer (REST) application programming interface (API). The Guidelines describe the properties to which an API specification and related implementation must adhere in order to be considered aligned to Ed-Fi Technology Suite standards. They do not describe a specific implementation technology.

## Governance

These guidelines are maintained by the Ed-Fi Alliance with the advice and consent of its [Technical Advisory Group](https://edfi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GOV/pages/20317491/Technical+Advisory+Group)(TAG): all changes of _substance_ are reviewed and approved by the TAG.
