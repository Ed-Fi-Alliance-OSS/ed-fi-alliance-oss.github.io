# Unifying Data Model - v5.0 Handbook

The Ed-Fi Unifying Data Model Handbook is a searchable reference that includes
definitions for every entity and element in the Ed-Fi Data Model. The UDM
Handbook complements the visual UDM diagrams by providing detailed type
specifications, cardinality, usage, an XSD (normative) and SQL (non-normative)
expression, and other information about the elements and entities that make up
the Ed-Fi Data Model.
