# Reporting Issues and Making Suggestions

To evolve and grow Ed-Fi data exchange standards and Ed-Fi Unified Data Model
(UDM), community input is essential. This page describes how to participate by
submitting new ideas and tracking the status of existing suggestions.

## Data Standard Work Group

The Data Standard Work Group (DSWG) is an entity within the Ed-Fi Governance
structure and is intended to enhance the communication, engagement and
collaboration of all segments of the Ed-Fi Community members with the Data
Standard team of Ed-Fi Alliance and within each other.

The main purpose is to represent the use cases and perspectives of the Ed-Fi API
users in the field to guide Ed-Fi data standards model with model update ideas
for the upcoming releases.

The group typically meets monthly; please see [Data Standard Work
Group](https://edfi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GOV/pages/263127121/Data+Standard+Work+Group)
for prior meeting notes and information on how to join the work group

## Ed-Fi Jira Project

The Ed-Fi Alliance tracks issues and feature requests in Atlassian Jira Cloud.
The [Data Standard
project](https://edfi.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/DATASTD/issues?jql=project%20%3D%20%22DATASTD%22%20ORDER%20BY%20created%20DESC)
is open for anyone in the world to read. Unfortunately, we are **unable** to
open this up so that Ed-Fi community could create or comment on issues.

## Submitting a Case

If you have questions or suggestions about how to use the Ed-Fi Data Standard,
proposed changes, etc, then please sign-in to the [Ed-Fi Community
Hub](https://community.ed-fi.org) to submit a "case" describing the situation.
Ed-Fi's customer success team will help ensure that your request is routed to
the data standard team.
