# Ed-Fi Unifying Data Model

## Introduction

The Ed-Fi Data Standards are built upon a Unifying Data Model (UDM), an
enterprise data model of commonly exchanged and shared Kâ€“12 education data. The
model includes entities such as students, teachers, assessment results,
attendance, and many others that will be easily recognized by professionals in
the education field.

The model was originally developed to capture and represent data related to
student performance, and that remains the core goal of the model. In addition,
the model has been expanded to some domains critical to K-12 education, but
indirectly related to student performance (e.g., staff assignments and
credentials).

The Unifying Data Model contains some domains with minimal coverage, generally
because other industry standards exist to cover data exchange in those areas. In
these cases, the model typically captures enough information to assist with
interpretation of data entities covered in the model, but not enough to drive
system interoperability. Curricular content is an example of a domain minimally
covered in the Unifying Data Model.

## Revisions

The Ed-Fi Alliance manages and revises the Unify Data Model annually. Please see
the [Roadmap for the Ed-Fi Technology Suite](../../0-roadmap/readme.mdx) for announcements about
upcoming releases. Each revision is given a version number that follows the
SemVer labeling conventions: major.minor.patch number (ex: 1.2.3), where a
change in the major number denotes that there are breaking changes, the minor
number denotes non-breaking additions, and the patch number is used to represent
bug fixes (in this case, "bug fixes" may be documentation-only updates).

Please see [Ed-Fi Technology Suite Supported
Versions](../../0-roadmap/supported-versions.md) for the version history of the
_Data Standard_, which encompasses the Data Model.
