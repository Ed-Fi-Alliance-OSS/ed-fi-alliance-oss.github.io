# Ed-Fi Technology Roadmap

The Ed-Fi Technology Roadmap provides information on the development plans and
release schedule for all components of the Ed-Fi Technology Suite.

The releases, feature sets, and dates on the roadmap are plans, not promises.
Organizations desiring to take critical dependencies on roadmap items are
advised to work closely with the Alliance staff.

## How to Read the Ed-Fi Technology Roadmap

The roadmap displays three columns on information about technology releases:

1. **Todo**: items that have not been started.
2. **In Progress**: items that are actively being worked on.
3. **Done**: items recently completed, ready for production use unless otherwise
   stated.
   * Releases will be removed after two quarters.

Referring to the numbered items in the screenshot below:

1. Use the tabs at the top to switch views, spotlighting different areas of the
   technology suite.
2. Each release lists the quarter in which it is intended to come out. As the
   release time approaches, a specific target date may be added.
3. Click on the release to view additional details, such as the product goal and
   a list of significant features. A link to the release notes will be added
   here once the item moves to Done.
