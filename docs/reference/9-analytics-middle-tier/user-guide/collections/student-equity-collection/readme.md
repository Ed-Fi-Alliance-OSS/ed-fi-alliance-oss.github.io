# Student Equity Collection

## Introduction

The Student Equity collection was built help answer the question:

> _Does our diverse student population have equitable access to the district's
> educational environment and offerings?_

The views are intended to simplify presenting student populations and their
participation in academic programs as well as outcomes for academics and
discipline.

## Views in this Collection

* [StudentDisciplineActionDim](./equity_studentdisciplineactiondim.md)
* [StudentSchoolFoodServiceProgramDim](./equity_studentschoolfoodserviceprogramdim.md)
* [FeederSchoolDim](./equity_feederschooldim.md)
* [StudentProgramCohortDim](./equity_studentprogramcohortdim.md)
* [StudentHistoryDim](./equity_studenthistorydim.md)

The student equity collection comprises dimension views that help to identify
students with different programs and services that they may belong to or
participate in.  The discipline Action and history dimensions provide additional
information on the student to understand the student equitable impact.
