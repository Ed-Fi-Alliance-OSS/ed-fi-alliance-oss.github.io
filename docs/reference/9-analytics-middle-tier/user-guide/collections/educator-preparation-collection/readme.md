# Educator Preparation Collection

## Introduction

The Educator Preparation collection was built to power the the EPP Starter Kit's
and help answer the following questions:

For the [Program Diversity and Persistence Starter
Kit](https://edfi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/22020300/Program+Diversity+and+Persistence+Starter+Kit)

> _Does the diversity of our candidate pool align with the areas the candidates
> will most likely be teaching in?_
>
> _Is our candidate pipeline (Candidate to Completed to Certified to teach) as
> healthy as we would expect?_

For the [Clinical Experience and Performance Starter
Kit](https://edfi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/22021402/Clinical+Experience+and+Performance+Starter+Kit)

> _Are our candidates performing as expected during their clinical experience
> (based on observational data)_
