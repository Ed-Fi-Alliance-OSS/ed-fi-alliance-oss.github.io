# AMT User Guide

## Introduction

The goal of the Analytics Middle Tier is straightforward: to simplify the
process of querying for data from the Ed-Fi ODS. That said, Data Analysts still
need to learn what each view provides and how optimally to use them, which is
the purpose of this guide. Otherwise, there is a real risk of misuse leading to
incorrect reporting.

## Collections

The Analytics Middle Tier contains a [core set of
views](./collections/core-view-collection/readme.md)Â as well as a
number of optional collections, including:

* [Assessment
    Collection](./collections/assessment-collection/readme.md)
* [Chronic Absenteeism
    Collection](./collections/chronic-absenteeism-collection/readme.md)
* [Early Warning System
    Collection](./collections/early-warning-system-collection/readme.md)
* [Engage Online Learners
    Collection](./collections/engage-online-learners-collection/readme.md)
* [Educator Preparation
    Collection](./collections/educator-preparation-collection/readme.md)
* [Row-Level Security
    Collection](./collections/row-level-security-collection/readme.md)

## Patterns and Practices

These documents provide a number of patterns and practices that may prove useful
in a production rollout of the Analytics Middle Tier solution. As with any such
guidance, readers will need to carefully evaluate applicability to their
systems, and consult with internal and/or external experts on business
intelligence systems, data architecture, system security, and so forth.
