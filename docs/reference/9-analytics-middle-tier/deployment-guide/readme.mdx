## Preparation

Before beginning the installation, you will need to:

1. Select a deployment model, which will determine the correct server and
   database names to use. The deployment options are:
    * Option 1. Installing into a replicated or log-shipped copy of the
      production ODS database (the [generally
      recommended](./limiting-impact-on-the-production-ods.md) approach).
    * Option 2. Directly installing on your production ODS database.
2. Decide which of the
   optional [Collections](../user-guide/collections/readme.md) to
   install, if any.
3. Ensure that the machine running the installation has network access to the
   database server, and that you can supply database credentials with sufficient
   access to create new objects in the destination database.
4. Review the following documents for awareness of security and performance
   considerations:
    1. [Limiting Impact on the Production
       ODS](./limiting-impact-on-the-production-ods.md)
    2. [Administrative
       Security](./administrative-security.md)
    3. [Improving ODS Query Performance With
       Indexes](./improving-ods-query-performance-with-indexes.md)

:::tip

We recommend using a [pgpass configuration
file](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/libpq-pgpass.html) to store
PostgreSQL user password. This approach allows the connection string to
contain a database user name without requiring a password.

## Installation

:::warning

There are two options for running the installer. The first option is that you
can run the installer by downloaded it to your machine or building it from
source control. The second option is you can run the installer from a docker
container. Both Step 1 options are described below.

:::

### Step 1 (option A). Download or Build from Source

* [Raw source
  code](https://github.com/Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/Ed-Fi-Analytics-Middle-Tier)
  (build instructions follow). Can be run from a Linux host.
* [Download a compiled
  release](https://github.com/Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/Ed-Fi-Analytics-Middle-Tier/releases)
  in either format:

    :::warning

    Binaries for version 2.0.0 and earlier are posted the older
    GitHub organization, pre-Apache License. To download the binaries, you
    must be signed in to GitHub with an account that has Ed-Fi licensee
    access.

    :::

  * `EdFi.AnalyticsMiddleTier.zip` (~2 MB) is a .NET Core framework-dependent
    deployment, meaning that you must have the [.NET Core 3.1 SDK and
    Runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) installed on the system on
    which you wish to run the application. Can be run from a Linux host.
  * `EdFi.AnalyticsMiddleTier-win10.x64.zip` (~30 MB) is a self-contained
    deployment, meaning that you can run it without downloading and installing
    .NET Core 3.1. Must be run from a Windows host.

Choose an appropriate version, download, and unzip the files.

### Step 1 (option B). Run the Installer from Docker

This option assumes you already have a docker environment set up and running.
If you don't have a a docker environment, consider using the existing installer
in the option A of Step 1.  The instructions below use [Docker
Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) for workstation
usage.  [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is also available for on-premise and
cloud providers as well.

* Images for Analytics Middle Tier (AMT) can be found at [Docker AMT
  Images](https://hub.docker.com/r/edfialliance/analytics-middle-tier)
* To run the installer in Step 2, your installation command will look like:

    ```powershell
    docker run -t edfialliance/analytics-middle-tier --connectionString "...." --options A, B, C
    ```

    :::tip

    See [Docker Deployment: (Optional) Step 9. Install Analytics Middle
    Tier](https://edfi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EDFITOOLS/pages/24119348/Docker+Deployment+2.x)
    for more information.

    :::

### Step 2. Run the Installer

#### Command Line Arguments

Command line arguments can be provided using either a "short flag" (e.g., `-c
"..."`) or "long flag" (e.g. `–connectionString "..."`).

| Short Flag | Long Flag | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| \-c | \--connectionString | REQUIRED. Full connection string for the SQL server database on which to install the solution. |
| \-e | \--engine | OPTIONAL. Database engine, either `SqlServer` or `PostgreSQL` . Defaults to `SqlServer`. |
| \-o | \--options | OPTIONAL. One or more optional use case collection names, space separated (e.g., `EWS RLS CHRAB Indexes`) to install the four collections EWS, RLS, CHRAB, and Indexes. If left blank, the installer will only create the [Core Views](../user-guide/collections/core-view-collection/readme.md).<br/><br/>The current available options:<br/><br/>_**Indexes** - This adds indexes to improve AMT performance<br/>_   **RLS** - [Row level security collections](../user-guide/collections/row-level-security-collection/readme.md)<br/>_**EWS** - [QuickSight Early Warning System collections](../user-guide/collections/early-warning-system-collection/readme.md)<br/>_   **CHRAB** - [Chronic Absenteeism collection](../user-guide/collections/chronic-absenteeism-collection/readme.md)<br/>_**ASMT** - [Assessment collections](../user-guide/collections/assessment-collection/readme.md)<br/>_   **EQUITY** - [Student Equity collections](../user-guide/collections/student-equity-collection/readme.md)<br/>_**ENGAGE** - [Engage Online Learners Collection](../user-guide/collections/engage-online-learners-collection/readme.md)<br/>_   **EPP** - [Educator Preparation Collection](../user-guide/collections/educator-preparation-collection/readme.md) |
| \-u | \--uninstall | OPTIONAL. Default: false. Removes all views and indexes, leaving in place the tables configuration tables and role `analytics_middle_tier`.<br/><br/>⚠️ Generally only used by developers. |

#### Running the Tool

The precise syntax for running the tool varies slightly depending on which
download and build strategy you have chosen. Examples are shown below for each
approach.

##### Connection String

The connection string will be in standard .NET format, for example:

<Tabs>

  <TabItem value="sqlserver" label="SQL Server">

    ```text
    server=yourServer;database=EdFi_ODS_ReadOnly;integrated security=sspi;
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="postgresql" label="PostgreSQL">

    ```text
    host=yourServer;database=EdFi_ODS_Readonly;username=postgres;
    ```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>


The detailed examples below leave the connection string out in order to focus
attention on other elements of the command.

##### From Source Code

Note that the "long flag" is required for the options when running from source
(e.g., use `--connectionString` and not `-c`):

```powershell title="Core Views Only, SQL Server"
cd Ed-Fi-Analytics-Middle-Tier\src
dotnet run --connectionString "..."
```

```powershell title="Core Views Only, PostgreSQL"
cd Ed-Fi-Analytics-Middle-Tier\src
dotnet run --connectionString "..." --engine PostgreSQL
```

```powershell title="Optional Indexes and Early Warning System Collection, on SQL Server"
cd Ed-Fi-Analytics-Middle-Tier\src
dotnet run --connectionString "..." --options Indexes EWS
```

##### Framework-Dependent Download

As with source code, when using `EdFi.AnalyticsMiddleTier.zip` you must provide
command parameters via the "long flag" form for options.

```powershell title="Core Views Only, SQL Server"
cd Ed-Fi-Analytics-Middle-Tier\src
dotnet EdFi.AnalyticsMiddleTier.Console.dll --connectionString "..."
```

```powershell title="Core Views Only, PostgreSQL"
cd Ed-Fi-Analytics-Middle-Tier\src
dotnet EdFi.AnalyticsMiddleTier.Console.dll --connectionString "..." --engine PostgreSQL
```

```powershell title="Optional Indexes and Early Warning System Collection, on SQL Server"
cd Ed-Fi-Analytics-Middle-Tier\src
dotnet EdFi.AnalyticsMiddleTier.Console.dll --connectionString "..." --options Indexes EWS
```

#### Self-Contained Executable

In this scenario, you can use the long flags as shown above or the short flags
as shown below.

```powershell title="Core Views Only, SQL Server"
cd EdFi.AnalyticsMiddleTier-win10.x64
.\EdFi.AnalyticsMiddleTier.Console.exe -c "..."
```

```powershell title="Core Views Only, PostgreSQL"
cd EdFi.AnalyticsMiddleTier-win10.x64
.\EdFi.AnalyticsMiddleTier.Console.exe -c "..." -e PostgreSQL
```

```powershell title="Optional Indexes and Early Warning System Collection, on SQL Server"
cd EdFi.AnalyticsMiddleTier-win10.x64
.\EdFi.AnalyticsMiddleTier.Console.exe -c "..." -o Indexes EWS
```

#### Using Docker

In this scenario, you can use the long flags as shown above or the short flags
as shown below.

```powershell title="Core Views Only, SQL Server"
docker run edfialliance/analytics-middle-tier --c "...."
```

```powershell title="Core Views Only, PostgreSQL"
docker run edfialliance/analytics-middle-tier --c "...." -e PostgreSQL
```

```powershell title="Optional Indexes and Early Warning System Collection, on SQL Server"
docker run edfialliance/analytics-middle-tier --c "...." -o Indexes EWS
```

Installing Additional Collections

An administrator can run the installation tool repeatedly with no harm; the
install is an idempotent operation. To install additional collections after the
initial install, simply re-run the tool and provide the additional collection
name(s) at the command line.

#### Common Errors Seen During Installation

When running the installer in a Non-Windows Environment, such as Linux, MacOS,
Windows Subsystem for Linux, or Google Cloud, you could receive the following
error:

```text title="Installation Error"
Error:
An assembly specified in the application dependencies manifest (EdFi.AnalyticsMiddleTier.Console.deps.json) was not found:
package: 'System.Data.SqlClient', version '4.6.0'
path: 'runtimes/unix/lib/netcoreapp2.1/System.Data.SqlClient.dll'
```

This error comes about due to one of the subfolders that was extracted from the
zip file not having the correct permissions. To resolve this you can run the
following command from the root of the contents of the extracted zip file:

```powershell title="Permission fix"
sudo chmod -R 755 runtimes/*
```

Once this has been done, then you should be able to run the installer
successfully.

### Step 3. Configure Database User Access

The installer creates a new security role in the
database, `analytics_middle_tier`, with permission to query all of the views in
the `analytics` schema. The database administrator will need to assign user(s)
to this role as appropriate. This can be done by issuing a command like:

```sql title="Add user to role"
ALTER ROLE [analytics_middle_tier] ADD MEMBER [someUserName]
```

Note that this does not substitute for applying [Row-Level Security
Collection](../user-guide/collections/row-level-security-collection/readme.md) in
the downstream applications. Since the user connecting to the database will have
access to all students' data, the end-user application needs to provide its own
appropriate row-limiting security features.

### Step 4. Configure Descriptor Mappings

The installation process automatically loads descriptor mappings that match up
with the default descriptors provided by the Ed-Fi Alliance in the "minimal
template" install of the ODS / API. These need to be reviewed and customized for
each field implementation.

For detailed information and instructions, please see [Descriptor
Mapping](./descriptor-mapping.md).

### Step 5. Configure Optional Features

Some of the optional
[Collections](../user-guide/collections/) have
their own configurability mechanisms. Please review and apply instructions from
each relevant collection below.

* [Row-Level User Security:
  Configuration](../user-guide/collections/row-level-security-collection/readme.md)
* [Early Warning System Collection:
  Configuration](../user-guide/collections/early-warning-system-collection/readme.md)
* [https://edfi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EXCHANGE/pages/22488932](https://edfi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EXCHANGE/pages/22488932)
