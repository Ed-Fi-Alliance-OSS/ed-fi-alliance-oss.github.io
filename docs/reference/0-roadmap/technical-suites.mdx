# Ed-Fi Technical Suites

## Introduction to Ed-Fi Technical Suites

Ed-Fi technology is organized into Technical Suites that represent a generation
of technology products that share a data model and are designed to work
together. Technical Suites enable clarity in communication and support for Ed-Fi
technology offerings.

In general, the Alliance manages its roadmap with the goal of providing "N-1"
support across Technical Suites and "N-2" support for releases within a suite.
However, where support cannot be handled efficiently (e.g., support is overly
complex due to underlying technical issues), or where Ed-Fi Community need is
low, the Alliance may make exceptions in order to maximize the value of
investments to the overall community. Please see [Ed-Fi Data And API Standard
Release Cadence](./cadence.mdx) for more detail.

The Ed-Fi Alliance encourages the community to stay current or upgrade to the
most recent Technical Suite, as well as the most recent versions of products and
tools within a suite. Please consult version release notes for details to ensure
compatibility to local requirements.
