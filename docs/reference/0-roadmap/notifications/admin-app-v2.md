# End of Support - Admin App v2.x

June 19, 2023

## What Is Happening

As of June 30, 2023, the Ed-Fi Admin App 2.x will have reached the [end of
support](./readme.md).

## What Should I Do Now?

Please consider moving to a new version of the Admin App to match the ODS / API
for the next school year; see [Ed-Fi Technology Suite Supported
Versions](../supported-versions.md)Â for a list of the supported options.

[Admin App v3.1](../../8-admin-app/readme.md) is compatible with ODS / API
versions 3.4 through 6.1 to pair the required ODS / API platform updates.
Please see the [End of Support - ODS/API v3.4 and v5.0](./ods-api-3-5.md) page
for related updates.
