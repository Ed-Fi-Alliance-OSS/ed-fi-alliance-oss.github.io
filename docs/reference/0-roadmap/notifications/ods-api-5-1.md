# End of Support for ODS/API 5.1 and 5.2

October 11, 2023

## What Is Happening

Earlier this year, we announced the [end of support for ODS/API 3.4 and
5.0](./ods-api-3-5.md). Going into 2024, it is not practical for the Ed-Fi
Alliance to formally support versions 5.1 and 5.2. Therefore we are officially
ending support immediately.

Please reach out via the [Community Hub](https://success.ed-fi.org) if this is
going to cause your organization a hardship, and we can explore potential
solutions with you.

## What Should I Do Now?

Please consider moving to a new version of the ODS/API for the next school year;
see [Ed-Fi Technology Suite Supported Versions](../supported-versions.md).

ODS/API 5.1 and 5.2 support Data Standard 3.2. The newer ODS/API 5.3 supports
Data Standard 3.3, which is backward compatible with its predecessor. Moving to
ODS/API 5.3 is one possibility. However, the Ed-Fi Alliance tech team is still
reviewing the work to convert ODS/API 5.3 to .NET 8. The .NET version used by
ODS/API 5.3 will itself be out of support in November, 2024. As of December 12,
2023, the Alliance has not committed to producing and ODS/API 5.4 with .NET 8
support. Instead, we ask affected parties to please evaluate [Data Standard
4.0](https://edfi.atlassian.net/wiki/display/EFDS4X/What%27s+New+-+v4.0) to see
if you can upgrade to ODS/API 6.x or ODS/API 7.x.
