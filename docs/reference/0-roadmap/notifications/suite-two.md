# Ed-Fi Technology Suite 2 - End of Support Notice

27 Jul 2021

:::warning

The Alliance intends to stop supporting Technical Suite 2 on July 31st, 2022.

:::

## How does this notice impact me?

The benefits and impact of end-of-support notices for Technical Suites depend on
your role in the Ed-Fi Community:

### Education Agencies currently on Technical Suite 2

➕ Provides context and incentive to secure budget and plan to upgrade to
Technical Suite 3. \
➕ Enables agencies to take advantage of new capabilities in Technical Suite 3. \
➖ Requires time and cost to upgrade.

### Technology Providers

➕ Data Providers: There is reduced cost to support the integration of products
with older versions. \
➕ Managed hosting providers and data consumers:  Able to take advantage of new
capabilities. \
➖ Managed hosting providers and data consumers: There is time and cost incurred
to upgrade.

### Ed-Fi Alliance

➕ Frees up budget and resources for current and forward-looking investments.

## What specifically changes when Technical Suite 2 is out of support?

### What Changes

* Tracker tickets on out-of-support versions will not be supported or
  investigated.
  * An exception to this is if a critical security vulnerability is identified
    and education agencies still have Technical Suite 2 in production.
* The Alliance stops releasing updates or enhancements to products within
  Technical Suite 2.
* The Alliance starts allocating additional resources and budgets towards
  working on defining and developing Technical Suite 4.

### What Does Not Change

* Ed-Fi licensees will continue to have full access to source code.
* All existing documentation on TechDocs will be retained.
* Ed-Fi community members can continue to offer support services (for example,
  System Integrators and Collaboratives).

## What should I do if my agency cannot upgrade to Suite 3 before July 2022?

As stated above, there is no change to access to code and documentation, so you
can continue to use Technical Suites 2 products for longer if necessary.
Additionally, we invite you to contact the Alliance to discuss options further.

## I have a question that is not answered above
