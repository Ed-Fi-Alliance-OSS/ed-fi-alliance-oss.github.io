# Advisory: Issues in Serialized Data Feature â€“ Update and Resolution

Sept 18, 2025

This advisory outlines recently identified issues in the Ed-Fi ODS/API platform's [Serialized Data](/reference/ods-api/platform-dev-guide/features/serialized-data) feature. The identified issues affect the **accuracy and consistency** of serialized representations.

The optional Serialized Data feature was introduced to enhance performance by storing resource data in a serialized binary format. To ensure data integrity during cascading key changes, the feature compares the `LastModifiedDate` of the resource table with the `LastModifiedDate` embedded in the binary data to determine whether the serialized data is current.

---

## Issue 1: Triggers on Aggregate Root Tables with Volatile Foreign Keys

- **Problem**: Triggers on aggregate root tables do not update the `LastModifiedDate` when foreign key values change due to cascading updates.
- **Impact**: The API incorrectly assumes the serialized data is current, even when foreign key changes should invalidate it.
- **Resolution**: Trigger logic has been revised to ensure `LastModifiedDate` is updated appropriately when foreign keys change.

---

## Issue 2: PUT Logic and Key Change Discrepancy

- **Problem**: When identity fields are modified via PUT, the two-step update process causes a mismatch between the `LastModifiedDate` on the record and the serialized data, falsely marking the serialized data as stale.
  - Step 1: Entity is updated with general changes, including `LastModifiedDate`.
  - Step 2: Key change is applied separately.

- **Impact**: Incorrect stale data determination subverts the serialized data optimization.
- **Resolution**: `LastModifiedDate` is now aligned with the serialized data after a key change, allowing the serialized version of the resource to be reused rather than rebuilt.

---

## Issue 3: HREF Resolution in Child Items with Unified Keys

- **Problem**: Child items with unified keys fail to resolve `href` values correctly.
- **Impact**: Serialized output contains placeholder GUIDs (e.g., `0s`) instead of valid references.
- **Resolution**: Serialization logic has been updated to correctly resolve unified foreign keys in the context of the parent entity.
