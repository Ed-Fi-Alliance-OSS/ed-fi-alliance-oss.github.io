# Getting Started

This documentation outlines the steps necessary to deploy and set up the Ed-Fi
ODS / API Admin App. The Admin App provides a user-friendly web-based interface
to perform common administrative tasks for an instance of an Ed-Fi ODS / API.

Admin App supports shared, year-specific and district-specific modes.  Admin App
does not support sandbox mode which is intended for development and the [Sandbox
Administration
Portal](https://edfi.atlassian.net/wiki/display/ODSAPIS3V520/Using+the+Sandbox+Administration+Portal)
is the tool to use for sandbox modes.

Admin App is a tool that is used to manage account access and other internal
information for the ODS/API Platform.  For this reason, we recommend running
Admin App only within internal, VPN-accessible and/or "extranet" networks with
proper firewall/infrastructure controls to maintain limited access for only its
administrative users.

## Audience

This documentation is for administrators and DevOps personnel who will be
installing the Admin App. The information herein may also be of interest to
users of the Admin App.
