# Support for Multiple Client Credentials Per Application

Admin API versions 2.2 and earlier do not support managing multiple credential sets for a single application. This capability was introduced with Admin API 2.3.

If you need to manage more than one client credential pair per application, please upgrade to Admin API 2.3 or later and follow the guidance in the [multiple credentials article for Admin API 2.3+](/reference/admin-api/getting-started/admin-api-2.3-newer/technical-articles/multiple-credentials-per-application).
