# Support for Multiple Client Credentials Per Application

:::info

This information is relevant if you are using Admin API 2.3 and forward

:::

Admin API 2.3+ now includes an endpoint to manage multiple ODS/API credentials for a single Application.

The `EdFi_Admin` database establishes a hierarchy of with a `Vendor` containing many `Application` records,
which in turn can contain many `ApiClient` records containing client credentials for the ODS/API. Previously, 
the Admin API application only allowed management of one `ApiClient` per `Application`, in spite of the 1-
to-many relationship in the database. The new endpoint now allows for management of an unlimited 
number of `ApiClient` records. The benefits include support for manual key rotation and the ability 
to link the distinct `ApiClient` credentials to separate [ODS Instances](../../../ods-api/how-to-guides/how-to-configure-ods-instances).

It now implements two different approaches

## Original approach (single set of credentials per Application)

You can manage a single set of credentials with the `/v2/applications` endpoint. In case
you want to reset these credentials, you can use the `/v2/applications/{id}/reset-credentials` endpoint.

## New approach (multiple credentials per Application)

When you create an Application, Admin API still creates a new set of credentials, but you can use
the `/v2/apiclients` endpoint to manage additional credentials.

:::warning

It's highly recommended that you disable the `/v2/applications/{id}/reset-credentials` endpoint
when working with the new approach, given that this endpoint will reset the first set of credentials
only for the given Application, and this might lead to confusing scenarios.

To disable this endpoint, go to the `appSettings.json` file and set the `EnableApplicationResetEndpoint`
property to false.

### Key rotation

You can use this new approach to manage planned key rotation. One posibility is:

1. Issue new credentials for an Application.
2. Wait for the client application to apply these new credentials.
3. Disable the previous credentials.
