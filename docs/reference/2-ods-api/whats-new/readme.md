# What's New

This documentation serves as an introduction to the features and significant
changes made for the Ed-Fi ODS / API for Suite 3 v7.2.

This release is targeted at deployment starting in the 2024-25 school year. The
Ed-Fi ODS / API for Suite 3 v7.2 is aligned with [Data Standard
v5.1](https://edfi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EFDS5/pages/26706990/What%27s+New).
There are no breaking changes between Data Standard v5.1 and the previous Data
Standard v5.0. Platform hosts should also be aware that there are changes to API
error response which may require modifications to API Client applications.
Additionally, this release requires implementers to update to [MetaEd
4.4](https://edfi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/METAED20/pages/23711107/What%27s+New)

See [What's New in v7.2](./whats-new-in-v72.md) for details.
