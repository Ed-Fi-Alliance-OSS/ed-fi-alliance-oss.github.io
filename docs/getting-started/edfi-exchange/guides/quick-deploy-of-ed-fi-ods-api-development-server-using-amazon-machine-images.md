## Description

The goal of these virtual machines is to have a quick way to stand up and explore the major versions of the Ed-Fi ODS/API. These virtual machines have proven to be very helpful for Education Agencies, and Software Vendors, such as Student Information Systems (SIS), and other EdTEch related vendors. The ease of standing up and tearing down within minutes helps get familiar and explore all the interoperability possibilities with the Ed-Fi ODS / API.

**\*NOTE:** It is important to note that these AMI's are for development purposes only.
