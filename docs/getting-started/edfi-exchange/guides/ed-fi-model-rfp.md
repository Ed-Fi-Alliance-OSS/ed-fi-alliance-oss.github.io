![Ed-Fi Logo](https://edfidocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/img/edfi-exchange/guides/ed-fi-image.png)

## Description

The purpose of this Model RFP is to support local education agencies (LEAs), Charter Management Organizations (CMOs), Ed-Fi consortia, state education agencies (SEAs), and Regional Education Centers to develop a Request for Proposals (RFP) from vendors to implement the Ed-Fi Solution.

The content of this Model RFP is written as if it were a request from an LEA for an extensive Ed-Fi implementation. LEA users should be able to leverage much of the structure and language from this model RFP to create a reasonable proposal suitable for their project. SEAs and consortia should find the structure and language of this document useful, but may need to make more significant modifications. All education organizations have procurement and purchasing guidelines of their own, and many have templates that must be followed, so you may want to consult your procurement office before starting any RFP.
