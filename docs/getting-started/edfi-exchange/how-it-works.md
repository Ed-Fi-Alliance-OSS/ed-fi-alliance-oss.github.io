## How the Ed-Fi Exchange Benefits the Community

**States**, **Districts**, **Technology Providers** and the **Ed-Fi Alliance** contribute solutions to the Ed-Fi Exchange that may be downloaded by other Ed-Fi Community members. Ed-Fi Exchange contributions may take the form of extensions to the Ed-Fi Data Standard, the Ed-Fi ODS and API, and Ed-Fi Dashboards in the form of plugins. In addition, conceptual documents such as technical white papers and implementation project overviews may be contributed to assist other licensees planning to leverage Ed-Fi technology.

The goal is to make the Ed-Fi Community **greater than the sum of its parts** by openly sharing innovations aligned to the Ed-Fi Data Standard.

## How to Fully Access Contributions

Only Ed-Fi Licensees can **download contributions** and **view contributing organization information** to learn more about their Ed-Fi aligned solutions. To get full access to the Ed-Fi Exchange, you can [request a license](#).

Once the Ed-Fi Alliance has verified your status as a licensee, you will receive an e-mail with instructions to log into the site. You will then be able to view additional solution detail, download contributions and contact solution contributors.
