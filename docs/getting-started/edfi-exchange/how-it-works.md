## How the Ed-Fi Exchange Benefits the Community

**States**, **Districts**, **Technology Providers** and the **Ed-Fi Alliance** contribute solutions to the Ed-Fi Exchange that may be downloaded by other Ed-Fi Community members. Ed-Fi Exchange contributions may take the form of extensions to the Ed-Fi Data Standard, the Ed-Fi ODS and API, and Ed-Fi Dashboards in the form of plugins. In addition, conceptual documents such as technical white papers and implementation project overviews may be contributed to assist other licensees planning to leverage Ed-Fi technology.

The goal is to make the Ed-Fi Community **greater than the sum of its parts** by openly sharing innovations aligned to the Ed-Fi Data Standard.
