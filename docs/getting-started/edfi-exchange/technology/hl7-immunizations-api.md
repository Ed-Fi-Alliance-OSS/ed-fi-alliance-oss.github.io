# HL7-Immunizations-API

![Ed-Fi Logo](https://edfidocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/img/edfi-exchange/technology/image.png)

## Description

The WI Department of Public instruction partnered with the WI Department of Health Services to integrate the WI Immunization Registry's (WIR) HL7 compliant web service into the Ed-Fi API.

The service uses a student's uniqueId to craft an HL7 compliant request for immunization data, using only authorized data, submits that request to the WIR, and returns the results within the Ed-Fi API.

:::info
> This service will NOT work out of the box, but can be used as a starting point for integration with an HL7 compliant service.
