## Description

 This project provides a solution to be able to roster Clever from an Ed-Fi ODS / API.

The solution is a .Net Core API that generates OneRoster standard endpoints off of the Ed-Fi ODS v3.x PostgreSQL database. This API URL is then configured in Clever to be able to sync Ed-Fi with the Clever rostering services. It is important to note that we did not implement the full OneRoster Spec. We only implemented the endpoints and functionality required by Clever.
