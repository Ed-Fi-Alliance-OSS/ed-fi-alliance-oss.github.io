# Description

The Educator Preparation Dashboard is the result of a grant funded project and a collaboration with many Educator Preparation Programs (EPPs), states, and districts. The metrics and visualizations represented in the dashboard represent the common, top priority use cases to inform teacher preparation effectiveness and program improvement. The Dashboard can be implemented along with the Ed-Fi Teacher Preparation Data Model extensions.
