## Description

This GitHub repository contains all code necessary to deploy the Ed-Fi API and Admin App via Google Kubernetes Engine. In this deployment, pgbouncer, a lightweight connection pool agent, sits between the Ed-Fi API and the ODS. The Ed-Fi ODS is deployed via Google Cloud SQL.

This repository should only be used by advanced users who are familiar with kubernetes. This repository was created to spark conversations around kubernetes and large scale Ed-Fi deployments.

If you are a LEA or collaborative interested in deploying Ed-Fi in Google Cloud, it is recommended that you utilize [this repo](https://github.com/K12-Analytics-Engineering/edfi) which deploys the API and Admin App via Google Cloud Run.
