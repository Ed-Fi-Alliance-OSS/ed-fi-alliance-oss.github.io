## Overview

The Ed-Fi Learning Standards Sync Utility is a tool for system administrators for synchronizing learning standards between the AB Connect API and a specified Ed-Fi ODS / API instance. Using the tool requires active credentials for both the target Ed-Fi ODS / API instance and the AB Connect API. The Sync Utility application provides a command-line interface (CLI) to set parameters and define options.
