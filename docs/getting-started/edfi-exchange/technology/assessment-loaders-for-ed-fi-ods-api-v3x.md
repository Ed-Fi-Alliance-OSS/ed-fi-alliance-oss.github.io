## Description

Delaware has created SSIS packages to load our (custom) accountability SAT score file and the standard NWEA files in a 3.1 ODS.

They are written using SQL Server Data Tools 2012.

The sources are CSV files we get from College Boards and NWEA. The SAT file is custom to Delaware (though of course others could request it), and used for our accountability, while the NWEA files are standard. Sample files are included, demonstrating the file formats
