## Description

The Analytics Middle Tier Community Contribution Repository is a place for community members to share their views into the data for other organizations to leverage.  Contributing your views helps other organizations re-use your work and promotes editing instead of having to create from nothing.  If contributions to the community repository become more widely used then we will consider curating the change within the main Analytics Middle Tier branches.

The Contributors repository has a simplified contribution process and minimal standards and guidelines.  This is to encourage everyone to share their work for others to use.
