# Aspire Chronic Absenteeism Text Notification System

![Chronic Absenteeism](https://edfidocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/img/edfi-exchange/technology/image2022-6-9_16-10-9.png)

## Description

The project deploys a text messaging solution that can serve text notifications from Ed-Fi ODS database.

The stand-alone text messaging solution sits alongside the ed-fi ods and uses custom tables, custom views and database procedures to schedule text messaging notifications to students. Once the solution is deployed the code could be customized to cater to your specific needs which may include customizing these notifications to be sent to other stakeholders. The solution uses a third-party plug-in from CDATA to interface with the text messaging provider such as Twilio.
