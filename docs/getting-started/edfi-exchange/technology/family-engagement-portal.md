## Description

The Parent Engagement Portal provides an easy-to-use view of student information, attendance, discipline, grades, and assessment scores with links to parent views in other applications. The Portal enables communication between members of the student’s “success team” by supporting text communications with automatic language translation.

The Portal was developed using responsive design, allowing execution of its web interface from personal computers, notebooks, and smart phones.
