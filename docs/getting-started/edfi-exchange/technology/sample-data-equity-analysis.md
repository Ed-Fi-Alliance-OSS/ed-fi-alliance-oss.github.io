## Description

The Ed-Fi Alliance's sample data sets have realistic but fictional names, attached to realistic but fictional schools and local education agencies. Do these data sets unduly perpetuate any demographic biases or demographic skew with respect to key student performance indicators?

To this end, we have developed a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) for performing rigorous statistical analysis on an ODS database: [Ed-Fi Sample Data Equity Analysis](https://github.com/Ed-Fi-Exchange-OSS/Sample-Data-Equity-Analysis/blob/main/Equity-Analysis.ipynb)
