## Description

The Research Spike was a MSDF-funded project with the goal of streamlining transcript and college readiness data sharing among LEAs and IHEs. There were two components to this project. First, we developed a draft transcript JSON standard, including ODS mapping of the data elements, and a transcript API based on composite technology. Second, we designed a user experience that supports transcript requestors, registrars, and transcript recipient user personas.
