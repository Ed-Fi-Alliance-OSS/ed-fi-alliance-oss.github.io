## Cloud Deployment  Strategies

One of the most common types of questions the Ed-Fi Alliance receives from new community members is "how do I install and run this software?" Increasingly, that question is posed with respect to cloud deployments. Given that the Alliance does not run its own software, and given the myriad ways of optimizing a deployment, it is difficult for us to have the expertise and bandwidth to provide detailed guidance on deployment architecture and security. At the same time, we are in frequent conversation with community members and can learn from them and reflect some practices back to the community. In that light we offer the following documents and tools that may be helpful in planning your own deployments. Some have been developed at the request of the Alliance, and other solutions are offered by the community. Please recognize the necessary limitations and "use at your own risk."
