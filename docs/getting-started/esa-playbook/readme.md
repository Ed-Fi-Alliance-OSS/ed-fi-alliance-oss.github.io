## Download the Playbook

Welcome to the Ed-Fi playbook for Educational Service Agencies in the K–12
ecosystem! Educational Service Agencies may go by a variety of names depending
on where you are in the country like Education Service Centers (ESC),
collaboratives, Counties of Education (COEs), Regional Information Centers
(RIC), etc.  These organizations also have slightly varying charters and
missions.  This information is intended to help you understand the major aspects
of building data system integrations using the Ed-Fi Data Standard that is
universal to Educational Service Agencies (ESA).

There are three intended audiences for this playbook:

* Agency executive champions can learn about Ed-Fi and understand the why/how of
  streamlining data collection and how Ed-Fi data standards can help with that

* Agency IT leaders can learn how to partner with Managed Service Provider(s)
  (MSP) as a means to expanding their work into providing data and analytics
  services to their LEAs

* Agency instructional technologists who may be assisting LEAs with the
  implementation of edTech platforms and want to expand their coaching
  abilities.
