# SEA Playbook: Advancing Data Utilization to Support Educator Preparation and Teacher Workforce

## About This Playbook

This playbook is designed for state education agencies (SEAs) that have implemented or are exploring integrated Ed-Fi infrastructure to support both state and local data needs. It is intended for states ready to deepen their use of the Educator Preparation Data Model (EPDM) to drive innovation within Educator Preparation Programs (EPPs) and support the educator pipeline.

The SEA Playbook equips state leaders with the tools and insights needed to leverage EPDM data for strategic decision-making and systemic improvement. Further it provides real examples of how SEAs, like the **Texas Education Agency** and **Indiana Department of Education**, are leveraging the EPDM to support educator workforce pathways.

Available in both PowerPoint and PDF formats, this resource is meant to be adapted and shared across teams to support statewide data modernization and continuous improvement efforts.

## TEA Spotlight: Putting Vision into Practice

Gain real-world insights from the Texas Education Agency and their Ed-Fi Data Standard-backed Insight to Impact Dashboard (I2I), which leverages educator candidate data to support continuous improvement efforts across the educator pipelineâ€”empowering preparation programs and local education agencies and fostering collaboration among key stakeholders.
