# Educator Workforce Use Case

## Background and Purpose

Persistent teacher shortages across the U.S. are particularly acute in areas such as science, bilingual education, special education, and math. This situation is further exacerbated by fewer new educators entering the profession and ongoing retention challenges.

In response, the Ed-Fi Alliance conducted a structured essential question (EQ) and visual design process aimed at addressing these staffing challenges through data-informed insights and visual reporting tools.

This collaborative effort identified and prioritized the essential questions that would be most impactful for districts, considering common staffing issues across different educational contexts. Through this process, three core EQs emerged. These EQs informed the development of corresponding mockups to provide targeted insights through dashboards, supporting districts in their strategic decision-making. The resulting EQs and dashboards help educational leaders to visualize key data, guiding actions that improve hiring, staffing equity, and educator retention.

Open‑source versions of these dashboards are available in both Power BI and Superset, along with resources to support data mapping for Ed‑Fi–powered Educator Workforce dashboards. This document outlines each essential question (EQ) and links to related technical and non-technical documentation.


## Essential Questions Summary

### EQ 1: Educator Hiring Summary/Vacancies

1. **Essential Question**: How do educator vacancies vary across the district/Education Service Agency (ESA)?
2. **Purpose** Guide strategic planning, identify vacancy patterns, promote staffing equity, and support policy development by visualizing where staffing gaps exist. Designed for education service agencies (ESAs) and local education agencies (LEAs).
3. **Use Case Documentation**: [EQ1 Hiring Summary/Vacancies Use Case Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQQflJvqhgml8DBOGnF3LNRUlnFStyQ48j3DqzjEG2wQdcCumM_ZIXqehGKoYivcg/pub)

### EQ 2: Educator Retention by Assignment

1. **Essential Question**: Are there certain assignments of educators that are connected to higher retention?
2. **Purpose**: Identify factors impacting educator retention, inform support strategies, and enable targeted retention interventions for assignments facing high turnover. Designed for education service agencies (ESAs) and local education agencies (LEAs).
