# Educator Workforce Use Case

## Background and Purpose

Persistent teacher shortages across the U.S. are particularly acute in areas such as science, bilingual education, special education, and math. This situation is further exacerbated by fewer new educators entering the profession and ongoing retention challenges.

In response, the Ed-Fi Alliance conducted a structured essential question (EQ) and visual design process aimed at addressing these staffing challenges through data-informed insights and visual reporting tools.

This collaborative effort identified and prioritized the essential questions that would be most impactful for districts, considering common staffing issues across different educational contexts. Through this process, three core EQs emerged. These EQs informed the development of corresponding mockups to provide targeted insights through dashboards, supporting districts in their strategic decision-making. The resulting EQs and mockups allow educational leaders to visualize key data, guiding actions that improve hiring, staffing equity, and educator retention.

This document summarizes each EQ and provides links to related documentation.
