# EPDM Overview

## Background

The preparation and support of educators is a shared responsibility between educator preparation programs (EPPs), certification agencies, and those hiring program completers. When everyone works together, the quality of the teaching profession is strengthened. To do their part and align their goals with a continuous improvement cycle, each of these groups needs access to better data at specific times in the educator pipeline.

In response to this need, UPD (now Crocus) conducted research, gathered requirements and developed technology to create the Teacher Preparation Data Model (TPDM), involving key players as stakeholders in the process and was developed from 2015-2018.In 2019, the Ed-Fi Alliance received funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to further

## About the Educator Preparation Data Model

The EPDM (formerly Teacher Preparation Data Model) extension enables comprehensive data aggregation over the span of a educator's entire career, from application to and enrollment into an EPP, through knowledge and skills demonstrated in fieldwork experiences, to placement and performance as an in-service educator. Educator preparation programs (EPPs), State education agencies (SEAs), Local education agencies (LEAs), and schools can access and review data through automated data connections to develop strategies to ensure educators are prepared to meet the needs of their students.

The Ed-Fi Alliance in November of 2021 released the EPDM Community and EPDM Core options for the EPP community. /wiki/spaces/GOV/pages/20334458 describes the additions and revisions identified to move a set of entities from the EPDM model into the Ed-Fi Standard- based on Ed-Fi EPP Starter Kit use cases. The  following provides a conceptual overview of the EPDM and the basic technology facts useful for those considering or starting a EPDM based implementation project:

## ​Changing the EPDM model installed

If you start with EPDM-Core, and decide later that you need EPDM-Community, you can make the change by installing a new instance of the ODS/API and following the install instructions.​

If you have already loaded data, the choices are:​

You can re-load data into the ODS/API without changes (since EPDM-Core is a strict subset) ​
If data can’t be reloaded for some reason, it would be possible to write database scripts to migrate data – but this would incur some additional time/cost​

## Future Plans

The Alliance plans to continue to work with the EPP community to identify further entities that are mature enough to move into Ed-Fi Core​

​The following are resources for getting information and engaging in the process:​

* Ed-Fi Community Governance – for convening the community and sharing information​
* Ed-Fi Technology Roadmap - for details on upcoming releases.​
* Ed-Fi Tracker – for submitting tickets.​
