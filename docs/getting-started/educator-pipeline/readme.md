# Educator Pipeline

The Ed-Fi Alliance strives to help key stakeholders within Educator Preparation
Programs (EPPs), state education agencies (SEAs), local education agencies
(LEAs), and education service agencies (ESAs) make sense of their disparate data
sets by bringing them all together in one place, the [Ed-Fi Data
Standard](/reference/data-exchange/data-standard). The data standard, along
with the Educator Preparation Data Model (EPDM) (previously the Teacher
Preparation Data Model) can manage data on an educator's full-career lifecycle,
from pre-enrollment through their time in an educator preparation program, the
certification process and in-service work at K-12 institutions, and the outcomes
of those students. In addition to the data model, we also offer insights into
some of the most essential questions that stakeholder's are asking, through the
following use case documents.
