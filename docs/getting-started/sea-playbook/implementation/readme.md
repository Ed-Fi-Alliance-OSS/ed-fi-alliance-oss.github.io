# State Education Agencies - Implementation

Most Ed-Fi opens-source product documentation – including the documentation for the core Ed-Fi ODS / API platform – can be located in the [Reference](/reference/ods-api) section of Docs. Those documents provide the most detailed accounts of how to use Ed-Fi's tools.

The documents in this section provide additional information important for SEAs in how Ed-Fi tools are used and on other SEA tooling important to the process.
