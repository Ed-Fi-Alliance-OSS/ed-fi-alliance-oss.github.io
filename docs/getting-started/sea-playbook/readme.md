## About the Playbook

Welcome to the Ed-Fi State Education Agencies (SEAs) - Implementation Playbook ("SEA Playbook").

The intended audience for the SEA Playbook is leadership of state data efforts. The Playbook explains the problems Ed-Fi is solving for states and how data modernization efforts can unlock statewide opportunity to support schools, teachers and students.

The Playbook is published in both a PowerPoint and PDF format. A PowerPoint format is provided as we encourage state leadership to adapt this content for use with their own teams.
