# Assessment Provider - Overview

## Introduction

As a vendor in the assessment space, you may have received inquiries from your clients regarding interoperability and the Ed-Fi data standard. This overview aims to shed light on the advantages of adopting and aligning with the standard, illustrating how doing so can benefit your organization and enhance your standing within the educational technology ecosystem.

By becoming an Ed-Fi Partner, your organization not only aligns with industry best practices but also stands to gain a competitive edge in the evolving landscape of educational technology. Below you will find many of the reasons your organization will benefit from implementing the Ed-Fi Data Standard.  We encourage you to explore the immense return on investment associated with embracing interoperability.

## Why Support the Ed-Fi Data Standard

### Security

Traditional methods such as flat files and downloadable data exports pose inherent security risks, including the need for humans to handle the files, making data breaches more likely. Embracing Interoperability means that data never leaves the boundaries of systems that have defined and well\-maintained security processes, mitigating risks and establishing a robust and trustworthy data transmission process.

### Comprehensive Reporting in a Timely Fashion

Data confined within a single application limits its potential insights. True interoperability empowers educational agencies to derive comprehensive reports by integrating data from various sources, including staff, Student Information Systems (SIS), and assessments. This holistic approach ensures a more informed decision-making process.  With the ability to provide teachers with formative and interim assessment data in the classroom right after the assessment is taken, they can have actionable data in nearly real time.

### Data Consumption

In addition to providing data, there is value in consuming data from the API to enhance your product's capabilities. For instance, as an assessment vendor, rostering students for assessments becomes more efficient and secure when utilizing the Ed-Fi API for this purpose. It also drastically increases the data quality of the returned scoring data – since you know that the students will match their roster data from the start.

As a trusted partner to educational agencies, it is reasonable to propose a reciprocal arrangement—requesting to consume data from your clients that is of mutual value fosters a collaborative relationship.

### Sales and Partnership Opportunities

Interoperability has evolved into a prerequisite when responding to Requests for Proposals (RFPs). Your agency clients, both existing and potential, increasingly seek plug-and-play integrations rather than bespoke solutions. By aligning with interoperability standards, you position your company as a partner capable of seamlessly integrating with diverse educational ecosystems.  

Recognize that your agency clients are not seeking to replicate your software functionality; rather, they aspire to engage with a committed partner. Providing data in the desired format establishes your organization as an integral part of their data ecosystem.

### Adaptability

Supplying raw data in the Ed-Fi standard offers a strategic advantage, enabling you to reduce the need for custom reporting requests and exports. Over time, this translates to significant cost savings. Unlike custom reporting, each Ed-Fi interoperability project streamlines subsequent efforts, with most requests becoming readily answerable through existing code.  

Embracing the core standard facilitates a transition away from the cumbersome process of handling custom and one-off reports. Instead, you can focus on delivering data for more comprehensive reporting tools, enhancing the overall value of your offerings.
