# Assessment Providers - Sandbox

_"I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand."_ _\-Confucius_

Rather than talk about data exchanges, let's see some in action. The following brief activities will allow you to see data flowing using an Ed-Fi API Sandbox.

These activities use a browser-based toolkit called Swagger UI. This toolkit allows your browser to send requests to the API and receive responses from the API. You can access the **Ed-Fi ODS / API sandbox** at [https://api.ed-fi.org/](https://api.ed-fi.org/). You can [read more about Swagger UI here](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/).

:::warning
These activities use the Ed-Fi ODS implementation of the Assessment API. Note that this implementation is only one possible implementation of the API and not the API itself (see [Overview of Ed-Fi Standards and Technology](../../../../project-planning/overview-of-ed-fi-standards-and-technology.md) on this point).
