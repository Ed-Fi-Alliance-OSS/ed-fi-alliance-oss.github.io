# SIS Providers - Certification

:::info

* The Ed-Fi Student Information Systems API v3 certification verifies that a Student Information System (the source system, or "provider") can manage a core set of data on a target system (the "consumer")
* The certification requirements originate out of needs from actual field implementation work in the Ed-Fi Community
* Synchronization MUST occur as changes are made during normal product usage

:::

The Ed-Fi Community worked together to determine a core set of data necessary to power various LEA analytics use cases. This collaboration resulted in a common ask to SIS providers ("become Ed-Fi certified"). This is powerful because it provides clarity around what data receiving LEA wants from a SIS provider and removes the need for a SIS provider to maintain custom extracts. The Ed-Fi SIS Certification encompasses [~40 Ed-Fi API endpoints](https://techdocs.ed-fi.org/display/EDFICERT/Student+Information+Systems+API+v3+Certification+-+Test+Scenarios#StudentInformationSystemsAPIv3CertificationTestScenarios-TestScenarios-TransactionalTestCases:~:text=in%20the%20API.-,Required%20API%20Resources,-For%20each%20API) the SIS provider must manage data on. Within each endpoint, each element is marked as either required, conditional, or optional.
