# Authentication and OAuth

In its _data exchange standards_ efforts (distinct from Ed-Fi's _technology development_, going back to a distinction made in the section [Overview of Ed-Fi Standards and Technology](../../../provider-playbook/technology-providers-project-planning/overview-of-ed-fi-standards-and-technology.md)), Ed-Fi recommends the use of OAuth for API implementers. This recommendation can be seen in the REST API Guidelines that the Alliance publishes:

* [Ed-Fi API Design & Implementation Guidelines](/reference/data-exchange/api-guidelines)

Accordingly, in the Ed-Fi open source technology development effort, the Ed-Fi ODS / API uses a version of OAuth for API authentication. More information can be found here: [Authentication](/reference/ods-api/client-developers-guide/authentication).
