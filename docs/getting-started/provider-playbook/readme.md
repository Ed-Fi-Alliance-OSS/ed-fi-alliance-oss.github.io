# Technology Providers - Implementation Playbook

## Welcome to the Playbook

Welcome to the Ed-Fi playbook for technology providers in the K–12 ecosystem! This information is intended to help you understand the major aspects of building data system integrations using the Ed-Fi Data Standard.

There are two intended audiences for the this playbook:

* The first three sections are for anyone who works at a K–12 technology company interested in Ed-Fi.
* The remaining sections are for software developers (though business analysts may find them helpful too).
