# I. Getting Data Flowing

This first section presents the basic information to allow you to interact with
the Ed-Fi API and get some early data flowing in a development setup.

## [Architecture](./architecture)

Describes the various parts of the Dashboard, including the role your
application plays.

## [Data Requirements](./data-requirements)

Describes the data elements provided by your product. Later sections will
describe the formats and processes by which that data is transmitted to the
Chronic Absenteeism Dashboard.

## [Understanding REST APIs](./understanding-rest-apis)

If you are new to REST APIs, this section provides some background material to
help you understand this system integration pattern.

## [Authentication](./authentication)

This section describes how your software authenticates with the API.

## [Authorization](./authorization)

This section describes how requests to the API are authorized: how does the API
determine if your system is authorized to read and write various data elements.

## [Online API Documentation and Sandbox](./online-api-documentation-and-sandbox)

The Ed-Fi Alliance maintains online Swagger documentation that is very useful as
a reference and early exploration tool.

## [Maintenance and Version Dependencies](./maintenance-and-version-dependencies)

Information on the version requirements for the Dashboard and where to receive
updated information on maintenance over time.

## [Sample Transactions](./sample-transactions)
