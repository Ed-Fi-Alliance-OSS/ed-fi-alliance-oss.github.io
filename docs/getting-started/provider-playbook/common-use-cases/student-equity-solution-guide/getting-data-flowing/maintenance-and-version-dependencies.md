# Maintenance and Version Dependencies

This Dashboard is based on the **Ed-Fi OSD / API for Suite 3 v5.2.0**
Information on that specific API version can be found by looking at [Online API
Documentation and Sandbox](./online-api-documentation-and-sandbox.md)

Future releases of the Dashboard may update or change the version
requirements. This will happen organically as the Ed-Fi Technology Suite and the core
Ed-Fi data model evolve over time. To track these changes, the Ed-Fi Alliance
publishes a number of resources.

* New releases of the Dashboard and ODS / API Platform are published under
  the [What's
  New](https://edfi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ETKB/pages/20875675/What%27s+New) page
  on Ed-Fi TechDocs.
* When a new release is made for the Dashboard or platform, the What's New
  pages for the product will describe changes - it is recommended to review this
  information to learn about changes
  * For example, here is the most recent platform page: [What's New in
    v5.3](https://edfi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ODSAPIS3V53/pages/24543313/What%27s+New+in+v5.3).
* The [Ed-Fi Technology
  Roadmap](https://edfi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ETKB/pages/20876094/Ed-Fi+Technology+Roadmap) describes
  upcoming, planned releases.
