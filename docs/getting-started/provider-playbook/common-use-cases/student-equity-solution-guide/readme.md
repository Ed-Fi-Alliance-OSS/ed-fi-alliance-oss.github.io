# Student Equity Solution Guide

## About the Student Equity Solution Guide

The Student Equity Starter Kit is a step-by-step guide designed to help local
education agencies, AKA school districts, understand, analyze and take
supportive actions with data to uncover gaps in students’ access and
participation in your school's educational offerings..

This Solution Guide for Student Equity helps Student Information System vendors
take the necessary steps to provide districts with the data needed to power the
starter kit.  

Vendor support for student equity encompasses the following steps:

* **Learn.** The Ed-Fi website has detail on Student Equity, and information
    about how others in the Ed-Fi Community have addressed the problem. Read
    more about how to [Solution
    Guide](https://www.ed-fi.org/solution-guides/ensure-equitable-access-for-students/) on
    [Ed-Fi.org](http://Ed-Fi.org).
* **Develop.** Add Ed-Fi capabilities to your product to support customers
    addressing chronic absenteeism. You will find the [Student Equity Starter

    below.
* **Test.** To fully realize the benefits of the Student Equity Starter Kit,
    and ensure your solution is field ready, we recommend selecting and working
    with an existing district customer to test your integration in a live, Ed-Fi
    implementation of the starter kit. Securing a district customer will allow
    you a reference point for future adoptees of this starter kit. Working with
    a local district agency is not required but it is strongly recommended.
* **Certify.** For vendor organizations that have completed integration with
    the starter kit using the vendor developer guide, apply for the API Domain
    Certification so you may be listed as a verified partner on
    [Ed-Fi.org](http://Ed-Fi.org).
