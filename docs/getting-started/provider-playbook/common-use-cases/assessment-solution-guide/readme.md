# Assessment Solution Guide

## About the Assessment Solution Guide

The Assessment starter kit is a step-by-step guide designed to help LEAs combine
assessment data from multiple measures and sources in one interface to gain a
comprehensive view of their learners’ progress.

This Solution Guide for this starter kit is designed to help Assessment and
Student Information System Vendors take the steps necessary to provide the data
these districts need to power the the starter kit.

Vendor support for Harnessing Multiple Measures of Assessment encompasses the
following steps.

* **Learn.** The Ed-Fi website has detail on using multiple measures to create a
    comprehensive view of the students' progress, and information about how
    others in the Ed-Fi Community have addressed the problem. Read more about
    how to [Help Your Customers Harness Multiple Measures of
    Assessment](https://www.ed-fi.org//solution-guides/help-your-customers-harness-multiple-measures-of-assessment/)
    on [Ed-Fi.org](https://www.ed-fi.org).
* **Develop.** Add Ed-Fi capabilities to your product  to support customers
    harnessing multiple measures of assessment. You will find the [Assessment
    Vendor Developer Guide](./readme.md)
    below.
* **Test.** To fully realize the benefits of Harnessing Multiple Measures of
    Assessment and ensure your solution is field ready, we recommend selecting
    and working with an existing district customer to test your integration in a
    live Ed-Fi implementation of the starter kit. Securing a district customer
    will allow you a reference point for future adoptees of this Starter Kit.
    Working with a local district agency is not required but it is strongly
    recommended.
* **Certify.** For vendor organizations that have completed integration with the
    starter kit using the vendor developer guide, apply for the API Domain
    Certification so you may be listed as a verified partner on
    [Ed-Fi.org](http://Ed-Fi.org).
