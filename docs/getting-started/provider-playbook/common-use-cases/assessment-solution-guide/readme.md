# Assessment Solution Guide

## About the Assessment Solution Guide

The Assessment Dashboard is a step-by-step guide designed to help LEAs combine
assessment data from multiple measures and sources in one interface to gain a
comprehensive view of their learners’ progress.

This Solution Guide for this Dashboard is designed to help Assessment and
Student Information System Vendors take the steps necessary to provide the data
these districts need to power the the Dashboard.

Vendor support for Harnessing Multiple Measures of Assessment encompasses the
following steps.

* **Learn.** The Ed-Fi website has detail on using multiple measures to create a
    comprehensive view of the students' progress, and information about how
    others in the Ed-Fi Community have addressed the problem. Read more about
    how to [Help Your Customers Harness Multiple Measures of
    Assessment](https://www.ed-fi.org//solution-guides/help-your-customers-harness-multiple-measures-of-assessment/)
    on [Ed-Fi.org](https://www.ed-fi.org).
* **Develop.** Add Ed-Fi capabilities to your product  to support customers
    harnessing multiple measures of assessment. You will find the [Assessment
    Vendor Developer Guide](./readme.md) below.
* **Test.** To fully realize the benefits of Harnessing Multiple Measures of
    Assessment and ensure your solution is field ready, we recommend selecting
    and working with an existing district customer to test your integration in a
    live Ed-Fi implementation of the Dashboard. Securing a district customer
    will allow you a reference point for future adoptees of this Dashboard.
    Working with a local district agency is not required but it is strongly
    recommended.
* **Certify.** For vendor organizations that have completed integration with the
    Dashboard using the vendor developer guide, apply for the API Domain
    Certification so you may be listed as a verified partner on
    [Ed-Fi.org](http://Ed-Fi.org).

## Let's Get Started

This developer guide describes the processes for assessment providers and
student information systems to develop the functionality in their platform to
provide data to an Ed-Fi API to power the Ed-Fi Assessment Dashboard.

### Assessment System

The Guide is divided into three sections. We recommend you go through the
following sections and subsections in order, but welcome you to skip forward
when you are already knowledgeable on a topic.

### I. [Getting Data Flowing](./getting-data-flowing/readme.md)

This first section presents the basic information to allow you to interact with
the Ed-Fi API and get some early data flowing in a development setup.

### II. [Understanding Ed-Fi APIs](./understanding-ed-fi-apis/readme.md)

This section explains design features specific to Ed-Fi APIs and how to
integrate with them. After completing this section, you should have the
knowledge to connect your system to an Ed-Fi API and successfully transmit
larger amounts of data.

### III. [Tools and Best Practices](./tools-and-best-practices/readme.md)

This section provides information on tools and best practices to assist in your
development and in the long-term maintenance and health of supporting
organizations using the Assessment Dashboard.

#### Next Steps

Upon completing development of the Ed-Fi API functionality, you can test the
features with a customer.
