The Guide is divided into three sections. We recommend you go through the
following sections and subsections in order, but welcome you to skip forward
when you are already knowledgeable on a topic.

## I. [Getting Data Flowing](./getting-data-flowing/readme.md)

This first section presents the basic information to allow you to interact with
the Ed-Fi API and get some early data flowing in a development setup.

## II. [Understanding Ed-Fi APIs](./understanding-ed-fi-apis/readme.md)

This section explains design features specific to Ed-Fi APIs and how to
integrate with them. After completing this section, you should have the
knowledge to connect your system to an Ed-Fi API and successfully transmit
larger amounts of data.

## III. [Tools and Best Practices](./tools-and-best-practices/readme.md)

This section provides information on tools and best practices to assist in your
development and in the long-term maintenance and health of supporting
organizations using the Assessment Starter Kit.

### Next Steps

Upon completing development of the Ed-Fi API functionality, you can test the
features with a customer.
