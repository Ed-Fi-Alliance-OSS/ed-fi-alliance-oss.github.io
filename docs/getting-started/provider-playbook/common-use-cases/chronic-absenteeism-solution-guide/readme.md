# Chronic Absenteeism Solution Guide

Welcome to the Chronic Absenteeism Solution Guide For Vendors!

## About the Chronic Absenteeism Solution Guide

The Chronic Absenteeism Starter Kit is a step-by-step guide designed to help
local education agencies, AKA school districts, identify trends in student
attendance using accurate, real-time attendance data and facilitate earlier
intervention to better support students.

This Solution Guide for addressing chronic absenteeism helps Student Information
System vendors take the necessary steps to provide districts with the data
needed to power the starter kit.  

Vendor support for chronic absenteeism encompasses the following steps:

* **Learn.** The Ed-Fi website has detail on Chronic Absenteeism, and
    information about how others in the Ed-Fi Community have addressed the
    problem. Read more about how to [Help School Districts Address Chronic
    Absenteeism](https://www.ed-fi.org/solution-guides/help-school-districts-address-chronic-absenteeism/) on
    [Ed-Fi.org](http://Ed-Fi.org).
* **Develop.** Add Ed-Fi capabilities to your product to support customers
    addressing chronic absenteeism. You will find the [Chronic Absenteeism
    Vendor Developer
    Guide](./vendor-developer-guide/readme.md)
    below.
* **Test.** To fully realize the benefits of the Chronic Absenteeism Starter
    Kit, and ensure your solution is field ready, we recommend selecting and
    working with an existing district customer to test your integration in a
    live, Ed-Fi implementation of the starter kit. Securing a district customer
    will allow you a reference point for future adoptees of this starter kit.
    Working with a local district agency is not required but it is strongly
    recommended.
* **Certify.** For vendor organizations that have completed integration with
    the starter kit using the vendor developer guide, apply for the API Domain
    Certification so you may be listed as a verified partner on
    [Ed-Fi.org](http://Ed-Fi.org).
