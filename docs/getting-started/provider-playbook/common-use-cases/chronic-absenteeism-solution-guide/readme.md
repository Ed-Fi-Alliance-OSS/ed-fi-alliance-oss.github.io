## About the Chronic Absenteeism Solution Guide

This Solution Guide helps Student Information
System vendors take the necessary steps to provide districts with the data
needed to dashboards and reports on chronic absenteeism.  

Vendor support for chronic absenteeism encompasses the following steps:

* **Learn.** The Ed-Fi website has detail on Chronic Absenteeism, and
    information about how others in the Ed-Fi Community have addressed the
    problem. Read more about how to [Help School Districts Address Chronic
    Absenteeism](https://www.ed-fi.org/solution-guides/help-school-districts-address-chronic-absenteeism/).
* **Develop.** Add Ed-Fi capabilities to your product to support customers
    addressing chronic absenteeism.
* **Test.** To fully realize the benefits of the Chronic Absenteeism Starter
    Kit, and ensure your solution is field ready, we recommend selecting and
    working with an existing district customer to test your integration in a
    live, Ed-Fi implementation of the starter kit. Securing a district customer
    will allow you a reference point for future adoptees of this starter kit.
    Working with a local district agency is not required but it is strongly
    recommended.
* **Certify.** For vendor organizations that have completed integration with
    the starter kit using the vendor developer guide, apply for the API Domain
    Certification so you may be listed as a [badged partner](/partners/badging/).

## Let's Get Started

This developer guide describes the processes for a Student Information System to
develop the functionality in their platform to provide data to an Ed-Fi API to
power the Chronic Absenteeism Starter Kit.

The Guide is divided into three sections. We recommend you go through the
following sections and subsections in order, but welcome you to skip forward
when you are already knowledgeable about a topic.

### I. [Getting Data Flowing](./getting-data-flowing/readme.md)

This first section presents the basic information to allow you to interact with
the Ed-Fi API and get some early data flowing in a development context.

### II. [Understanding Ed-Fi APIs](./understanding-ed-fi-apis/readme.md)

This section explains design features specific to Ed-Fi APIs and how to
integrate with them. After completing this section, you should have the
knowledge to connect your system to an Ed-Fi API and successfully transmit
larger amounts of data.

### III. [Tools and Best Practices](./tools-and-best-practices/readme.md)

This section provides information on tools and best practices to assist in your
development and in the long-term maintenance and health of supporting
organizations using the Chronic Absenteeism Starter Kit.

### Next Steps

Upon completing development of the Ed-Fi API functionality, you can test the
features with a customer.
