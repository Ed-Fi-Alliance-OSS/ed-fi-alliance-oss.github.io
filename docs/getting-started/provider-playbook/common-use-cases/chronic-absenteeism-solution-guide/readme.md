## About the Chronic Absenteeism Solution Guide

This Solution Guide helps Student Information
System vendors take the necessary steps to provide districts with the data
needed to dashboards and reports on chronic absenteeism.  

Vendor support for chronic absenteeism encompasses the following steps:

* **Learn.** The Ed-Fi website has detail on Chronic Absenteeism, and
    information about how others in the Ed-Fi Community have addressed the
    problem. Read more about how to [Help School Districts Address Chronic
    Absenteeism](https://www.ed-fi.org/solution-guides/help-school-districts-address-chronic-absenteeism/).
* **Develop.** Add Ed-Fi capabilities to your product to support customers
    addressing chronic absenteeism. You will find the [Chronic Absenteeism
    Vendor Developer Guide](./vendor-developer-guide/readme.md) below.
* **Test.** To fully realize the benefits of the Chronic Absenteeism Starter
    Kit, and ensure your solution is field ready, we recommend selecting and
    working with an existing district customer to test your integration in a
    live, Ed-Fi implementation of the starter kit. Securing a district customer
    will allow you a reference point for future adoptees of this starter kit.
    Working with a local district agency is not required but it is strongly
    recommended.
* **Certify.** For vendor organizations that have completed integration with
    the starter kit using the vendor developer guide, apply for the API Domain
    Certification so you may be listed as a [badged partner](/partners/badging/).
