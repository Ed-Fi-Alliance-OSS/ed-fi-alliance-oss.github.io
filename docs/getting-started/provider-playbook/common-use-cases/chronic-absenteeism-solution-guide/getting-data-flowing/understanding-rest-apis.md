# Understanding REST APIs - Chronic Absenteeism-VDG

Your data gets to the Starter Kit via the Ed-Fi ODS platform's API. The Ed-Fi
API uses standard REST conventions and JSON as its data format language.

A REST API is a common pattern in software development; if you are not familiar
with this pattern, we recommend these resources:

* [REST API
    Overview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)
* [Video about REST APIs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-BpqyOT3a8&)

The entire Ed-Fi ODS / API is extensive, but your application will only interact
with a few of these API resources. Those are covered in the sectionÂ [Data
Requirements](./data-requirements.md).
