# Ed-Fi Credentialing

Ed-Fi has two different types of credentials, Certifications and Badges.  

## Certifications

Ed-Fi certifications allow:

* Product developers to demonstrate a product's fidelity to Ed-Fi standards and guidelines
* Purchasers and users to be confident that a product conforms to those same Ed-Fi standards and guidelines

The program's goal is to ensure that systems can interoperate and exchange data using Ed-Fi standards and technology.

Note: Certification is a test of the formal standards, but it also integrates and tests against best practice.

## Badges

Ed-Fi Badges allow product developers to demonstrate support for Ed-Fi standards and technology, particularly in areas that are not yet covered by an Ed-Fi Certification.
