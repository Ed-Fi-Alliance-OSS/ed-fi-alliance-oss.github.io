# Data Exchange Standards

The [Ed-Fi Alliance](https://www.ed-fi.org/) coordinates and publishes
[community-led
standards](https://www.ed-fi.org/what-is-ed-fi/ed-fi-data-standard/) for
education and the exchange of education data.

## Ed-Fi Data Standard

The Ed-Fi Data Standard is the widely adopted,
[CEDS-aligned](https://ceds.ed.gov/), open-source data standard developed by the
educational community for the betterment of the community. The Ed-Fi Data
Standard serves as the foundation for enabling interoperability among secure
data systems and contains a Unifying Data Model designed to capture the meaning
and inherent structure in the most important information in the Kâ€“12 education
enterprise.

[All Versions](https://edfi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ETKB/pages/20875717/Ed-Fi+Technology+Version+Index#Ed-FiTechnologyVersionIndex-Data-Standard)

## Ed-Fi API Standard

An Ed-Fi compatible API application creates a REST-based interface for data
exchange, where the messages conform to the Ed-Fi Data Standard. The Ed-Fi
ODS/API is the Ed-Fi Alliance's production-ready reference implementation of an
Ed-Fi API. Any interested party can build an alternate, compatible, application,
by adhering to the Open API specifications and guidance provided in this space.

If one looks at the Data Standard as a language, then the API Standard defines
how to encode and transmit information using that language.

## Applications

The Ed-Fi Alliance, and others, produce Ed-Fi API implementations: software
compatible with Ed-Fi API standards and specifications. See [Ed-Fi Technology
Suite](../technology-suite/) for more information on the Ed-Fi API software and
other support tools managed by the Ed-Fi Alliance.
