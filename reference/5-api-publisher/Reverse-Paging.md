# Implementation of Reverse Paging

This is the result documentation of [APIPUB-62](https://edfi.atlassian.net/browse/APIPUB-62)  

## In relation to how Publisher does pagination

Publisher does pagination in 2 levels. The first one is done using the Change Version feature from the Web Api. The second one is done using the offset and limit parameters.

At a high level, the execution it works like this.
1. Get the total number of records.
2. Using the changeVersionPagingWindowSize app setting determine how many windows will be processed. 
3. Loop trough the number of Change Query windows.
    1.  Get the total number of records for that specific Change Query window.
    2. Based on that number determine how many Offset-Limit windows will be processed.
4. Based on all this information prepare the GET requests that will be sent on the next step.
	
Notice that at this point Publisher does not get the real data yet. It just prepares all the GET requests that will be necessary to retrieve all the records.
It is until the previous process ends (when all the GET requests have been prepared), that Publisher starts actually getting the data from the source.

## The problem

The problem where a record (or a number of records) can be skipped is described [here](https://github.com/edanalytics/edfi_api_client?tab=readme-ov-file#change-version-stepping) (taken from the Jira ticket). 

At a high level, the problem they describe is that there could be scenarios where one or more records can be skkiped from the process and so they will never be published to the target. Part of this problem accurs because they execute Publisher on an active database.

What they propose to fix the problem is to execute the Offset-Limit pagination in reverse mode, so that the last page is processed first, and the first one is processed last. 

## Reproducing the issue on Publisher

Reproducing this problem seemed to be trick. But the help of Visual Studio and the execution in Debug mode (with break points, etc.) we accomplish to reproduce it, so the problem does exist.

## In relation to how to implement this on Publisher

1. We will add a flag (on false by default) where the user will be able to decide if he wants to execute Publisher in reverse paging mode.

## Other notes

1. Tests will be tricky without the capabilities of Visual Studio in debug mode and with a set of break points.
