# Requirements - Re-Certification

A partner MAY re-certify a product at any time, and MUST re-certify before
expiration in order to avoid losing its certified status.

A certification is considered a "recertification" only if that same product has
previously been awarded the same Ed-Fi certification and that product can
generally be considered to have evolved from the same code base and technology
as the previously certified product. For example, a product that was acquired
from a third party and substituted in the market for a previously certified
product would not be eligible for recertification.

Recertification requirements are described under the applicable
certification *–* consult [Available
Certifications](../1-available-certifications/readme.md).
