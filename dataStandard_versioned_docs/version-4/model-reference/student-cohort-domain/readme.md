# Student Cohort Domain

The Student Cohort domain represents a wide variety of collections of students
that are distinct from class rosters or program participants. This could include
students that are tagged for interventions or students tagged for the purposes
of tracking or analysis, such as a school principal's "watch list."

The domain can also be used for groupings such a school counseling groups and
athletic teams, supporting use cases where supervisory staff in those areas have
access to student records for the purposes or monitoring and assisting with
student performance.
