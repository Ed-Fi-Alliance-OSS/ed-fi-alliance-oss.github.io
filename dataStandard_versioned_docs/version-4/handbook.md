# Unifying Data Model Handbook

The Ed-Fi Unifying Data Model Handbook is a searchable reference that includes
definitions for every entity and element in the Ed-Fi Data Model. The UDM
Handbook complements the visual UDM diagrams by providing detailed type
specifications, cardinality, usage, enumeration lists, an XSD (normative) and
SQL (non-normative) expression, and other information about the elements and
entities that make up the Ed-Fi Data Model.
