# Enrollment Domain

The Enrollment domain model supports cases in which a student is limited to
enrollment in only one school at a time as well as cases in which a state may
have policies supporting multiple school enrollments. The model semantics assume
that a student is withdrawn in the previous grade level and enrolled in the next
grade level when promoted.
