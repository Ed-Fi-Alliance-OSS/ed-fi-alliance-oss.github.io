# Educator Preparation Data Model Domain

The Education Organization domain defines the organizational structure,
hierarchy, and other associations of education organizations. The
EducationOrganization entity serves as an abstraction for attributes and
associations common to all levels of an education organization hierarchy,
typically including schools, school districts and other local education agencies
(LEAs), regional educational service agencies, and state education agencies.
