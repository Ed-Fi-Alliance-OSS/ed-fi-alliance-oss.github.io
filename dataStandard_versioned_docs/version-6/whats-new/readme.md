# What's New

## Overview

Data Standard v6 introduces changes to the Ed-Fi Unifying Data Model (Ed-Fi UDM, aka
Ed-Fi core model) for domains commonly

to the v5 Data Standard, with the most recent release being [Data Standard v5.2](/reference/data-exchange/data-standard/).
Key breaking changes in Data Standard v6 include:

- decoupling demographics and contact information from StudentEducationOrganizationAssociation into dedicated entities
- adding optional identity entities for managing multiple identifiers
- updating the assessment model
- expanding core coverage of Educator Program with new domains such as Credential, Educator Preparation Program, Path, Performance Evaluation, and Recruiting & Staffing.
