# Graduation Domain

The Graduation domain model captures graduation requirements, such as credits
and coursework required for graduation, and references to required assessments.
The information to determine if a student has fulfilled these requirements is
typically held in the [Student Academic Record
Domain](../student-academic-record-domain/readme.md),
which holds course transcript data.

The domain includes some entities to capture student outcomes after graduation,
such as enrollment in college or other postsecondary events.
