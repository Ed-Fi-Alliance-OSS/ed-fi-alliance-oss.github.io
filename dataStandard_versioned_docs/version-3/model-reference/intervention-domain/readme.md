# Intervention Domain

The Intervention domain describes educational interventions and, more generally,
supplemental education services aimed at improving a student's understanding of
concepts, materials or skills necessary for success in school. Interventions
span from in-classroom teaching methods to formal out-of-class intervention
programs, and are often deployed for students with special needs or who are at
risk.
